Summary of ICP_5:

This Assignment has 2 questions to be solved using python pandas,sklearn and matplotlib.

1). Implement Naïve Bayes method using scikit-learn library

    Train the given dataset glass.csv using Naïve Bayes predict glass type and calculate accuracy score.
    
2). Implement linear SVM method using scikit library

     Train the given dataset glass.csv using linear SVM predict glass type and calculate accuracy score.
     
  Which algorithm you got better accuracy? Can you justify why?
  
     Support Vector Machine is giving better accuracy.For this particular dataset navies bayes is having low accuray.It may be due to Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in aclass is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.
