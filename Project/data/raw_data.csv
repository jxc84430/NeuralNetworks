There‚Äôs no need to cut off fruits from your diet and miss out on all the vitamins, minerals, and nutrients they can provide. Let‚Äôs take a look at the top 9 fruits that are the best to eat when you have diabetes.

üö®Let us help you manage your diabetes with Klinioüëâhttps://bit.ly/3D7mFViüö®
________________________________________________

A study by the Harvard School of Public Health revealed eating fruit was linked to up to 23% lower risk of type 2 diabetes. But the emphasis here should be on ‚Äúsome fruits.‚Äù Eating the wrong fruit, or even overeating the right fruit, can rapidly spike your blood sugar. But some fruits are loaded with soluble and insoluble fiber, which prevents blood sugar fluctuations by slowing down carb digestion and absorption of glucose. 

Here‚Äôs the list of top 9 diabetes-friendly fruits that won‚Äôt send you on an insulin rollercoaster.

#1: Blueberries. Blueberries are about 85% water, with an entire cup containing only 84 calories, 15 grams of carbs, and 4 grams of fiber. Studies link them to improved insulin resistance and a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

#2: Tart Cherries. Tart cherries provide 60 calories, 15 grams of carbs, 13 grams of sugar, and 2 grams of fiber per cup. Their dark red color comes from anthocyanin, a compound that protects against heart disease, cancer, and other diseases. 

#3: Peaches.  One medium-sized peach provides 58 calories, 14 grams of carbs, 12 grams of sugar, and 2 grams of fiber. One study shows that polyphenol-rich peach juice combats hyperglycemia and insulin resistance.

#4: Apricots. The apricot is known for being rich in vitamin A, known as the ""good eyesight vitamin."" It‚Äôs also one of the safest fruits you can eat to keep your blood sugar stable. In 2 fresh apricots, there are 34 calories, 8 grams of carbs, 6.5 grams of sugar, and 1.5 grams of fiber.

#5: Apples. Apple scores a 32 to 38 GI, which means it doesn‚Äôt instantly spike your blood sugar. One medium apple is almost 86% water and provides 95 calories, 25 grams of carbs, 20.6 grams of sugar, and 4.4 grams of fiber.

#6: Oranges. When it comes to diabetes, comparing apples to oranges is a smart thing to do. A juicy, sweet orange can be a healthy part of a diabetes-friendly diet. But monitoring your intake is key. Just one medium-sized orange has your daily requirement of vitamin C. It also provides 62 calories, 15 grams of carbs, 12 grams of sugar, and 3.1 grams of fiber.

#7: Pears. If you ever have trouble getting enough fiber into your diet, then pears should be your first pick of fruit to snack on. One medium pear has 5.5 grams of fiber, which is nearly 20% of the daily recommended intake. It also contains 101 calories, 27 grams of carbs, and 21 grams of sugar. Pears, when combined with apples, have been proven to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes by 18%.

#8: Kiwi. This tropical, zesty fruit is a real vitamin C powerhouse. Kiwi is a fiber-rich superfood that helps healthy gut bacteria thrive, indirectly helping to keep blood sugar in check. It‚Äôs also rich in carotenoids which help protect against heart disease. One normal-sized kiwi fruit has 42 calories, 10 grams of carbs, 2 grams of fiber, and 6 grams of sugar.

#9: Grapefruit. One grapefruit has vitamin A, vitamin B6, potassium, and nearly an entire day‚Äôs worth of vitamin C. A medium-sized grapefruit has 52 calories, 13 grams of carbs, 11 grams of sugar, and 2 grams of fiber. While this fruit has been proven to improve blood sugar control, it may negatively interact with some medications, notably metformin. Consult with your doctor before making it a daily staple.

WRONG! There's no need to cut off fruitsfrom your diet and miss out on all the vitamins, minerals, and nutrients theycan provide, not to mention the juicy sweetness missing from the typicaldiabetes-friendly diet. So let's take a look at the top 9 fruits that are the bestto eat when you have diabetes. All right, let's take a quick look at what research has to say aboutfruits and diabetes. A study by the Harvard Schoolof Public Health revealed eating fruit was linked to up to 23% lowerrisk of type 2 diabetes. Another study shows that some of the fruits have anti-obesity,anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic benefits that can even loweryour ‚Äúbad‚Äù LDL cholesterol. Sounds great, right? But the emphasis hereshould be on ‚Äúsome fruits.‚Äù Eating the wrong fruit or even overeating the right fruit can rapidlyspike your blood sugar. So why does some fruitget the green light? The short answer is fiber. The fruits I'll share today are loadedwith soluble and insoluble fiber, which as study after study shows,prevents blood sugar fluctuations by slowing down carbdigestion and absorption of glucose. So here's the top 9 diabetes-friendly fruits that won't send youon an insulin rollercoaster. #1: Blueberries. A real diabetes superstar, according to the American Diabetes Association. Blueberries are about 85%water with an entire cup containing only 84 calories, 15 grams of carbs,and 4 grams of fiber. These nutrient-dense berries are packed with vitamin C, vitamin K,potassium, and polyphenols that give them anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and gut-regulating abilities. Studies also link them to improved insulin resistance and a lower riskof developing type 2 diabetes. #2: Tart Cherries. Tart cherries provide 60 calories, 15 grams of carbs, 13 gramsof sugar, and 2 grams of fiber per cup. Their dark red color comesfrom anthocyanin, a compound that protects against heart disease,cancer and other diseases. They also have nine times the vitamin Acontent of blueberries, with one serving delivering 25%of the recommended daily dose. #3: Peaches. A synonym for sweetness, you'd hardly think of peachesas a diabetes-friendly fruit. One medium sized peach provides 58 calories, 14 grams of carbs,12 grams of sugar, and 2 grams of fiber. This one study shows that polyphenol rich peach juice combat hyperglycemiaand insulin resistance. When you're strapped for options to indulge your sweet tooth,nothing beats a sweet and juicy peach. As long as you don't gooverboard with it, of course. #4: Apricots. It's the peaches smaller yetstill tart and sweet cousin. The apricot is knownfor being rich in vitamin A, known as the ""good eyesight vitamin."" It's also one of the safest fruits youcan eat to keep your blood sugar stable. In 2 fresh apricots,there are 34 calories, 8 grams of carbs, 6.5 grams of sugar,and 1.5 grams of fiber. This sweet summer jewel goes well in youroatmeal, cereal, and seasonal fruit. #5: Apples. An apple a day keeps the blood sugar at bay. Rich in fiber and vitamin C, it's the most popular fruit in the worldfor a reason: it scores a 32-38 GI, which means it doesn't instantlyspike your blood sugar. One medium apple is almost 86% waterand provides 95 calories, 25 grams of carbs, 20.6 gramsof sugar, and 4.4 grams of fiber. It really is the perfect on the go snack that can also be throwninto any salad or cereal bowl. #6: Oranges. When it comes to diabetes, comparingapples to oranges is a smart thing to do. A juicy, sweet orange can be a healthy part of a diabetes-friendly diet,but monitoring your intake is key. Just one medium-sized orange has yourdaily requirement of vitamin C. It also provides 62 calories, 15 grams of carbs, 12 grams of sugar,and 3.1 grams of fiber. #7: Pears. If you ever have trouble getting enough fiber into your diet, then pears shouldbe your first pick of fruit to snack on. One medium pear has 5.5 grams of fiber, which is nearly 20%of the daily recommended intake. It also contains 101 calories,27 grams of carbs, and 21 grams of sugar. Pears, when combined with apples, have been proven to lower the riskof type 2 diabetes by 18%. #8: Kiwi. This tropical zesty fruit isa real vitamin C powerhouse. Kiwi is a fiber-rich superfood that helps healthy gut bacteria thrive, indirectlyhelping to keep blood sugar in check. It's also rich in keratinoids,which help protect against heart disease. One normal sized kiwi fruit has 42 calories, 10 grams of carbs,2 grams of fiber, and 6 grams of sugar. #9: Grapefruit. I included this citrus fruit on thislist with a note of caution. One grapefruit has vitamin A, vitamin B6, potassium, and nearly an entireday's worth of vitamin C. A medium sized grapefruit has 52 calories, 13 grams of carbs, 11 gramsof sugar, and 2 grams of fiber. While this fruit has been provento improve blood sugar control, it may negatively interact with somemedications, notably metformin. Consult with your doctor beforemaking it a daily staple. There's simply no need to see your food choices as black and white when there'sa whole rainbow of fruit you can enjoy. Before adding any of these fruits to yourmeal rotation, try checking your blood sugar post-meal to seehow they affect you.

""In our practice, we have an opportunity to treat bariatric patients in a very hands-on way. We have the advantage of the entire healthcare system and the resources behind it to afford us that opportunity.""

""Our patients, characteristically are evaluated at The Center for Weight and Eating Disorders, at the Sleep Center as well. The resources of the health system also give them an opportunity to be evaluated by our endocrinologists in a way that allows them to see their medical problems, their diabetes, really fad away, melt away as they're recovering from these operations.""

""One of the benefits of participating in bariatric surgery in the Penn Health System is really the research. We are really on the forefront and have the advantage and opportunity to really peer into the future. We're looking at the way different bariatric procedures affect different medical problems; such as diabetes in particular. We look at ways that different instruments and instrumentation can affect hunger and peoples willingness or desire to eat as well.""

""The Center for Weight and Eating Disorders as well as The Diabetes Institute really afford us great resources and great collaborators to move forward.""

""Our goal, when we meet these patients, is really to tell them that we're committed to life long follow-up. We communicate with their primary care physicians really every step of the way. One patient that comes to mind is a gentleman who works in the public sector.  Last year, he participated in the Broad Street run and really struggled. Actually had to stop before it was over. But this year, he finished the race.""

gonna talk about carb counting and meal planning it is much easier than you think watch cool now if you've been paying attention up and until now you probably got a lot about what carb counting is about because when we count that when we calculated the insulin to carb ratio we were actually talking about counting carbs or that was the beginning of counting carbs two components to the counting carb game right and that is first component is how many grams of carb is in this food and then how many units do I take to cover those cause one two equals three means you got it there is nothing more complicated to it than that all right so let's take it from the top we'll go through some talking about what carbs are as they differ from protein and fat in the old days those are the dinosaur when I first got diagnosed with diabetes you had what was called an ABA exchange diet meaning that because you took some regular insulin and you took some and pH insulin and you took them and they behaved like robots you had to have a meal plan that matched the insulin and they were both connected lockstep meaning I had to eat about the same amount of food on a daily basis because I was taken about the same amount of insulin on a daily basis now even in the old days if you really knew what you were doing you were already doing insulin to carb ratio stuff and like there was always times when my parents figured out that if I wanted to have more carbs I should take more insulin it's a game that we play having diabetes and managing it you want to have the right amount of food now I could teach you there's no one food over another that's better or worse if you are sort of a religion that believes that in order to get to heaven you have to have eight Big Macs a day I could teach you how to do that so the other things that we need to think about as we're sort of looking historically at how things were and we're talking now about the world of carb counting is two things that go into carb counting and eating is number one your family values regarding food so like I said if you want a Big Macs a day I could teach your diabetes wise how to manage that and take your insulin for that if you were just the family have um you like um raw vegetables and fruit strips and that was your diet I might argue with you that that wouldn't be the best way to do it but I could teach you how to manage that diabetes wise so the things that we need to think about when we're talking about carb counting or meal planning and it's much more flexible than it used to be but I'll make a point if you really knew what you were doing in the old days it was just as flexible meaning nothing really new has been that discovered we just call it by different names alright but the two variables that we need to think about is one or the two factors that go into sort of meal planning is one your family values around food which has nothing to do with diabetes alright it just has to do with either healthy or unhealthy eating and how to manage it diabetes wise again I'll tell you that no matter what your values are about food I can teach you how to do it from the diabetes perspective all right so I'm not as I'm talking about food here saying good or bad or making any value judgments about any kind of approach I'm just saying this is how you do it based on your values this is how you'll use this is what you'll use to get the way you want to get through so when we talk about carb counting we usually think in terms of exchanges now exchanges was the meal planning thing that you used to get from the American Diabetes Association or the Canadian Diabetes Association or Australian diabetes Australia where I will tell you all right Joe you have to have 1,800 calories you have to have 1,800 calories per day and you have to have these number of calories at breakfast these number at lunch these number at dinner this is your snacks and that was how you have to do it because you had that insulin that was going like that and usually the break up in terms of the nutrients that food is made up there are three basic food groups discs carbohydrates proteins and fats and usually in a diet that we're talking about that's healthy somewhere in between 50 to 60 percent carb 30 to 20 percent protein maybe 10 to 15% in fact this is somewhat flexible but this is usually how things break down for most of us all right when your carb counting what we're saying in diabetes today to make it more flexible and easy for you is that you know what we don't have to really consider insulin for protein and we really don't have to consider insulin dosing for fat because if you look at the impact of each one of those food types on blood sugar carbohydrate makes your blood sugar go like that protein makes your blood sugar go like that and fat really doesn't do anything to your blood sugar at all except maybe slow down the rate of absorption of the protein and the carbohydrates so where we've come to now is your dietitian will say to you based on your height and weight and sort of caloric needs Joey I want you to have 45 grams of carb at breakfast and I think you'll be meeting your caloric intake of calories and stuff if you have 60 grams of carb at lunch and if you have 60 grams of carb at dinner we do need some carbs the thing that you need to know is that having diabetes doesn't mean that we're allergic to sugar it means that we don't have insulin in our body and what that means is that we have to we have to eat like anybody else we just have to compensate with insulin so again there's no food that's not okay for a person with diabetes I hate it when I go to a friend's house and they say Oh Joe everybody's getting brownies and ice cream for dessert but we made you some delicious fruit compote with no sugar added that for me is and I'm close to homicide when that happens it's like I want to be able to eat with everybody else eats and that's what this is about is teaching you guys how to eat what you want to eat if your parents say to you that you can have 45 grams of carbohydrate by eating a cup and a half of ice cream for breakfast who might argue with that they're your parents you can get those 45 grams in however you want or if your parents say you need to have one slice of bread which equals 15 grams you need to have one small banana which is 15 grams and you need to have one cup of milk which is about 12 grams that sort of gets you to about 45 that the dietitian said you need it you can have it however you want that's what we're talking about the only thing you have to worry about sometimes is a thing called the glycemic index and what is that it's a value that talks about and refers to the quickness with which a particular carbohydrate gets into your bloodstream now for me when I look at rice it has a very high glycemic index all I have to do is look at rice and my blood sugar goes up but for an orange that has fiber in it it doesn't work as quickly as rice so it has a lower glycemic index but those are the only things that you have to think about when you're doing your carbs and you're thinking about your insulin dose and that kind of stuff right what you want to think about is the rate at which the car gets in and basically striking some kind of balance between what you love what your parents say you have to eat and eating healthily alright now it's really important to know is this also is that when we have a day and you're checking your blood sugars remember we said that you need to do at least four blood sugars per day well I can tell you this at least before every meal and really best to see how your insulin to carb ratio is working is to check an hour and a half to two hours after eating all right so I check say now that I need my blood sugar before eating is 7.8 or 140 I take four units for my 45 grams that should land me at 7.8 and 140 after I eat or before I check at lunch but I want to see how it did here one and a half to two hours afterwards maybe it went really sky-high to ten point two you know or you know one ninety and I don't want it to go so high after the meals so the reason for checking your blood sugar after you eat which goes hand in hand with the carb counting and the amount of carbs that you have is that you may based on your post meal blood sugar determine that you need to take a different kind of carbohydrate instead of orange juice you might want to take a whole orange that has the fiber that'll slow the rate of absorption with a lower glycemic index you may find that even though theoretically it worked out that your insulin to carb ratio was four units for 45 grams a car you may see that in the doing the check after the eating that you might have to tweak that a little bit that's what we're talking about in terms of getting a sense again the more you check your blood sugar the more information you have the easier it'll be to get smoother control and stay within target zone 80% 70 to 150 or three point nine to eight point three that's where we want to end up you know a lot of things to play with right but that's basically what carb counting and meal planning is about the presumption is that if you have 45 grams at breakfast sixty grams of carb remember at lunch and 60 grams of carb at dinner that you'll be interspersing that and adding to that all of the vegetables and protein that come with a healthy balanced diet or meal or eating plan or whatever you want to call it that doesn't make you sort of get nuts right putting food in your mouth right now some vegetables have sugar in them you know eating a lot of protein might have an effect also on your blood sugar so some vegetables have carbs and some protein if you eat over six to eight ounces of meat you might have to take more insulin to cover that I know when I go to a steak house whatever my amount is that I'm supposed to take for the meal and I have a big steak and I love steaks then I have to take more insulin to cover that and I might not have to take all of that insulin right up front but I'll have to be on top of my game for the next four or five hours to make sure that what I'm giving and what I've given is taking it you can do whatever you want it's your diabetes your body I will tell you this it's not like walking a tightrope over Niagara Falls what do I mean by that what I mean is is that the more mistakes you make the more you learn the more you learn the more comfortable you get with doing the things that you can do to tailor the general principles and guidelines that we've been talking about to suit your needs that's the whole goal of learning how to manage this thing is for you to have your life not for you to have my life right and the nice thing about diabetes is is that when you're doing these little changes doing them smartly let your parents know your pair should let your doctors and dietitians and diabetes nurse educators know that you're doing these changes in an attempt to learn how more to be able to manage and manipulate your tools to suit what you want to do so the worst that could happen is that you'll have a low blood sugar and then you'll have to have some skittles that is the worst that could happen or your blood sugar goes up a little bit and you take it and correct it with some insulin based on your insulin sensitivity factor when we've been talking about today in diabetes talk talk is giving you things and stuff that you can do tweak it up and down and to make it work for you so the food thing is really important now the one food that we didn't talk about that really is a bear for everybody in the diabetes world is pizza and the reason that pizza is such a bear is because there's that thing again will you eat that pizza it's got a lot of carbs in it if you're eating you know slice or two but what it's also got is a lot of fat and that fat slows down the rate of the carb absorption so that you may eat your pizza at lunchtime and you take your let's say let's say you calculate you need seven units for the amount of pizza that you're eating what ends up happening a lot of time is that your blood sugar be going like this and if you've eaten pizza and you've taken all the seven units at one time your blood Sugar's gonna drop because all of that fat is slowing down the rate of Zoar and you're taking seven units and those seven units are kicking in so what you want to do with pizza is I usually do it something like this I take two units upfront and then I tell my pump which is why pumps are really great I tell my pump give me the other five units over six hours and that's how works for me some people say you know what they take that seven units and they say I want three and a half now and three and a half or a 50/50 split of what's called a combo bolus or an extended bolus well based on the principles that we're talking about nothing new here just a little bit of a tweak here and there pizzas got a lot of fat don't want to give all your insulin upfront but you want to cover it over time all right let's do that let's take some insulin up front and then we'll give the rest over an extended period of time it's hard to do that with MDI in terms of multiple daily injections and basal bolus what you might have to do there is give yourself a little bit of insulin every hour or so over those time but it's doable it's up to you how you want to work it all right cool the other thing that we didn't talk about and this is not that relevant for kids but it is relevant for adults that have type one is maybe if they're having it for a long time you have a little of what's called gastroparesis and that means that your stomach doesn't empty as quickly as it used to because of some sort of long-term nerve damage now that's what's also nice about the pump you can work it like a piece of pizza meaning that if it takes a long time for food to get digested right let's say I eat lunch and it doesn't get digested immediately when I eat the food right and my blood sugar if I took all my insulin right up front would drop and then would eventually go hi what I can do is tell my pump again you know what I'll take two and a half units now and I'd like to take the rest over a longer period of time to help with some of that slower gastric emptying but that's not something that a lot of kids have to worry about but I thought I would throw it in just so that you guys have a sense about it all right good deal one other aspect about carb counting and meal planning that's really important and it relates specifically to effective carb counting because how well you count those carbs will determine how well and how accurate your insulin to carb ratio is so one aspect of carb counting at least in the United States and North America and Canada is reading food labels a little bit of an art to that because they can be tricky what do I mean well at the top it'll say one serving has and then a little kind of carbohydrates and it'll say 30 grams now you'll think wow one serving has 30 grams so I'm having one thing and that's got 30 grams of carb not then you have to see each portion contains two servings now if you just thought that it was one serving in this thing that you're eating you'd only be covering for 30 grams of carbohydrate and you'd be missing you know 30 grams so in this thing that you're eating it has actually 60 grams of carbohydrate which is going to have a big difference on how much insulin you take to cover those carbs so that's important when you're reading food labels also you'll see this sort of breakdown of all the major food groups and there may be a thing here that says sugar alcohols I'm not gonna go into that today but that does have some effect on how you read the carbs that would be something that you want to talk about with your dietitian in terms of how much to include that and how much not do usually when I'm doing this as a rough place I just sort of stick with the available carbohydrates unless it's particular kind of food that has a high sugar alcohol content and then I don't want to be bola Singh for something that's not going to raise my blood sugar up but that's still considered as sugar all right so good to look at either a book called the calorie King to get a better understanding of that and also to check with your dietitian about how to calculate for sugar alcohols in your food but if you don't have access to a dietician or if you don't have access to a calorie king or a dietician then if you just sort of go with the carbohydrates for most foods this sort of calculation will work alright the better you read the food labels the more accurate your insulin to carb ratio will be and the more easy it will be for you - yes that's what I was gonna say stay in range 80% of the time cool Bon Appetit great so that wraps it up today for the carb counting and meal planning and understanding food labels and the different food groups the next time we get together we'll be talking about sick day rule management certain rules managing sick days effectively so that you don't end up in the hospital or doing your best to not end up in the hospital and the use of glucagon you	Low Medical Info

disorders and diabetes today and how many of you have heard the term diable amina okay two years ago maybe one person would have raised their hand and I've been doing this work for about ten years seeing patients primarily treating women and and teenage girls with this problem but I had this strange experience where Joslin Diabetes Center as bill said because we're pretty well-known in the area we get a lot of publicity calls and sort of journalists call us and ask you know we have a communications department will you please speak to so-and-so about whatever and they know that I pretty much will talk to anybody about anything and so they always filled anything that has anything remotely to do with emotions they throw my way and this one actually happened to be about my area so I was even more excited but the guy I somehow missed something and the guy was asking me for like a local Florida story like did I did I know any patients in Florida who were struggling with this and so somehow I thought it was like a local newspaper story in Florida and it turned out it was this and he actually works for The Associated Press wire service and a day after it was published it was on 900,000 newspapers across the world actually and so I sort of had the funny experience of googling myself and I was in China and these very strange things so so the term died bulimia as I hope you know is actually a term that's been created by the press it's not a term that I really agree with and it's it's actually a term that I have some issues with because number one my brother makes fun of me about it because he thinks it sounds like diabolical and what kind of nonsense is that I'm not real doctor I'm only a PhD he has so he just likes to throw that around and and also because I think it runs the risk actually of reducing this problem to one problem when in fact what it is is two very distinct chronic diseases namely an eating disorder and type 1 diabetes and I'm mostly going to be talking about type 1 because that's where my research is although I do do a lot of work with eating issues and weight issues in type 2 so I'm happy to answer questions about that as well but this phenomenon is primarily understood in type 1 and and has to do with the intentional manipulation of insulin doses for the purposes of weight loss through hyperglycemic calorie purging so women and girls intentionally skip insulin shots or under dose insulin shots run their Sugar's high and lose the majority of their calories in their urine through glycosuria so what I'm going to do tonight is talk to you about eating disorders in general I haven't found sort of a pissy or way of explaining that so I call it eating disorders in general because what I mean is eating disorders not in the world of diabetes and then I'll talk also about some possible connections between eating disorders and type 1 diabetes and the talk primarily focusing on case examples and treatment strategies that I've found helpful and hopefully we can discuss some of your own cases because I think that's really where the rubber hits the road and where people are more interested so I just have this little disclaimer at the beginning which is that the connections between eating disorders and diabetes that I will be discussing are primarily derived from my own theorizing but strongly informed by the research and writing and my colleagues in Toronto doctors Gary Rhoden and Patricia Colton and Marian Olmstead who are really the leaders in this field my discussion of treatment strategies will be rooted in research on eating disorders outside the context of diabetes naively created clinical interpretation which and voodoo because largely we don't know how to treat this population and so the task at hand is really to look at the eating disorders research and the eating disorders treatment research and try to understand okay how do we take what's known and understood about treating eating disorders and uniquely tweak those those strategies to tailor them to the specific needs of women with type 1 so anorexia nervosa is the refusal to maintain body weight at or above minimally normal weight so these are the sort of classic stereotype when you think of eating disorders to see this very emaciated waif-like image anytime I'm in the airport I see these on all the tabloid magazines the latest Hollywood starlet struck down by an eating disorder and it actually has sort of the the mythology that this is a sexy sort of spectacular Hollywood fabulous kind of lifestyle and I think what's missing there is that this is actually a psychiatric disease which causes tremendous pain and heartache and massive torment to the person and their family members and their loved ones and and major major medical medical problems so these are the women who have intense fear of gaining weight even though they're already at an at a very low body weight and and actually have sort of distortion in their self-image where what they're seeing in the mirror is something actually very different than what we're seeing when we're looking at them so they can coint and show you you know I have fat right here I have fat right here and they perceive themselves very differently than how we're actually seeing them it also happens to have the absence of at least three consecutive menstrual cycles because the body the female body at such a low weight is not a safe body to have a pregnancy so body sort of preserves energy and didn't have a menstrual cycle bulimia nervosa is very very connected in the underlying thought process and the underlying sense of self that women with anorexia struggle with but but bulimia nervosa these women are typically either normal weight or slightly overweight and so these are actually the unseen unrecognized people who are struggling with an eating disorder and this is actually where the majority of patients with type one male and diagnostically but we'll talk about that a little bit more so this is where they're recurrent episodes of binge eating which is very different than the kind of eating you guys are doing right now binge shading is defined as eating a larger amount than your than your peers would but it has to be accompanied by a sense of loss of control and so there's this psychological aspect to it that it feels like chemical reaction has started and the person is completely out of control of the behavior and I think the question that that this really that this particular little piece of the diagnosis really really begs is what is the same what is the peer group when you're talking about someone with type 1 diabetes how do you define a binge in the context of type 1 diabetes is that any deviation from the meal plan is it over treating a hypoglycemic episode is it eating the same as your same age peers without diabetes but that's actually overeating for them but it's binging for you because your blood Sugar's go higher it's totally confusing I think in this particular arena and so we don't really know how to define binge eating in type 1 but connected to that there has to be calorie purging and in bulimia nervosa most typically what people think of is self induced vomiting or possibly laxative abuse maybe compulsive over-exercising but the area for type 1 diabetes in the early 80s you started to see a lot of research that was basically an academic debate between psychiatry and this sort of very categorized diagnostic criteria and people who were actually treating women with type 1 who we're saying we've got these women who are running their Sugar's high they're running all sorts of medical risks developing complications early they have an eating disorder and psychiatry was saying no no no they don't because it can't be purging it's not vomiting it's not laxative abuse it's not a compulsive exercise and it's not until DSM 4 which is only 2 DSM's ago which is our Diagnostic and Statistical Manual that they actually included the misuse of other medications as a symptom of bulimia nervosa and so in other chronic disease states like thyroid disease you have manipulation of thyroid medicine in other disease states like cystic fibrosis you have manipulation of the pancreatic enzymes as a means of calorie purging and and in our case with type 1 selectively or intentionally under dosing or even skipping insulin doses to produce hyperglycemia for the purpose of calorie wasting into the urine and so then you get into the sort of person in kiddy has to happen this many times per week in order to count as a diagnosis but what's really fundamentally similar is that whether you're talking about anorexia or bulimia or any kind of eating disorder these are women whose sense of self is defined by their body image and there's no that you know there's you can never be too rich or too thin they can never be too thin eating disorder nos nos means not otherwise specified this is actually where about 75% of patients with eating disorders land diagnostic and if you look at the eating disorders research it's all this very squeaky-clean academic research where it's looking at pure categories of anorexia nervosa pure categories of bulimia nervosa and not this sort of slightly blurry hodgepodge of it's a really low weight person but occasionally she binges and maybe she purchased sometimes but not at the same level of frequency and it's earned runs the risk did this is where the majority of patients actually are but by calling it Nos not otherwise specified sort of implies that it's this not really clinical category and it's it's absolutely not true eating disorders are very medically compromising and they are that whether they're Nos or bulimia or anorexia so here's the prevalence and this is outside the area of diabetes anorexia nervosa affects between 0.5 and 1 percent of late adolescent and adult women I mostly speak about women actually during this talk because we'll get to it a little bit later but the ratio of women to men with eating disorders is 10 to 1 so the majority of patients are in fact women bulimia nervosa is twice the rate of anorexia between one and two percent and then here's the edge noss is what they call it eating disorder not otherwise specified which is again you'll see at a much higher rate and that's only in college aged women 10 percent but again there used to be this idea in the eating disorder scientific literature that this was primarily an adolescent and young adult woman woman's problem and what we've learned is it's more like a chronic vulnerability that follows women into adulthood and into middle adulthood and probably in children dolt hood as well so approximately a thousand women die annually to nervosa it's the most lethal psychiatric disorder that that exists over five million Americans have eating disorders and 15 percent of young women have what's called substantially disordered eating so this is the problem where as a researcher doing this kind of work you know part of part of what you need to do when you're trying to study a phenomenon is you need to find a normal control group right so you need to find women in the United States who don't have problems with their body image good luck right so okay so this is what my mentor from way back in college called she wrote this landmark paper in a million years ago called women and weight a normative discontent and what her point was is that you can't find women in in indulge in excuse me in industrialized nations who don't struggle with body image even the top fashion models will say oh you know there's this little pocket right here on my left thigh where I wish I could you know shave something off they're airbrushed so it's it's really hard this has become a normalized anxiety but there is this blurry boundary between body image disturbances and eating concerns or eating issues struggles with eating disorder sort of sub-threshold symptoms and then going further along the continuum toward eating disorders that actually create medical risk and I think in the context of type one diabetes it becomes very very complicated because even at what we would normally consider a sub-threshold kind of kind of symptom picture we know that it causes medical risk so women who you know occasionally skip insulin because they have a fancy event goto and they want to fit into a really important fabulous dress they're causing damage to their bodies and that's what sort of in the non diabetes world people who do the sort of cabbage soup diet or something really crazy that's medically nonsense but not at that same level of risk so I think it's important to understand that within the context of type 1 even the sub threshold symptoms cause risk and cause damage so who is that greatest risk we used to think it was primarily Caucasian women now there's actually some some pretty good evidence to show that it's not really about being white it's about being westernized that it's primarily the industrialized culture and possibly media's role who the heck knows what's causing this but that women in in most industrialized countries have this risk 15 to 25 is sort of a typical typical blip in terms of where you're gonna see the most new onset of eating disorders and again men to women it's one man for every 10 women and one of the precipitance is a pattern of rigid dieting so here's where we start to see the initial threads of why women with type 1 might be at greater risk so if you think about the ways that both the exchange method of meal planning or the carbohydrate counting method of meal planning or even way back when before the discovery of insulin when it was the starvation method of meal planning rigid dieting has been part of the way we educate patients with type 1 diabetes and I think we need to think differently about that message I think that needs to be more flexible the concepts need to be less black and white less good bad less moralistic and we can get into that a little bit later we know that when we talk about when we talk about who's that greatest risk from sort of a hobby or professional standpoint we talk about gymnast models ballet dancers in men wrestlers and jockeys are at greater risk and I think again if you think about chronic disease models where there's such an attention on weight and on eating it makes sense that type one would fall into this category so here are some of the possible connections puberty is a diagnostic peak for both type one and eating disorders so you're taking a time of tremendous vulnerability for girls and sort of creating the perfect storm if you want to think of it that way type one presents with initial weight loss and often times I've had patients talk to me about this initial sort of they mean something different by the honeymoon phase they don't mean sort of there's still some pancreatic function they mean that they're not quite feeling as ill as they get later but they're starting to lose some weight and they're kind of feeling sluggish and not so hot but they're getting all this positive response from their friends from their from their peers from their teachers from their coaches you look great what's your secret and then it tips over the edge where they actually feel like their body is eating them alive and and now they wind up in the hospital possibly with DKA possibly not diagnosed with type 1 diabetes rehydrated put on insulin their body regains to a healthy body weight and they learn insulin made me fat even though their body is actually returning to a healthy body weight right so so there is some learning that happens right there a diagnosis I'm not suggesting that that's exactly where the eating disorder starts I don't believe that that's true actually but I believe that's where for some people type one treatment involves attention to meal planning as you all know it involves attention to weight to exercise activity level and in its in its worst caricature I would argue that some diabetes education actually mirrors the mindset of an eating disordered person assigning kind of moral qualities to food that's good that's bad that's off limits chocolate chip cookie is crack cocaine don't do it concepts of cheating instead of eating those kinds of things and and then we also know on the flip side even though weight is really it is really a focus for some endocrinologists of their treatment we know that intensive blood glucose control intensive insulin management actually promotes weight gain so if you look at the DC CT data you know that the intensively managed group actually gained 10 or 11 pounds more on average than the treatment as usual group and and that's a hard pitch to sell to a young woman who sees her pant size increasing and who's acutely aware of how her body is different than than the ideal so this is some of the research that was done in eating disorders and type 1 so far so again I mentioned to you that this original debate was you know is it an eating disorder is it not is it a higher risk group is it not and this study Jones 2000 which came out in the British Medical Journal this is from the Toronto Group that I mentioned earlier they really sort of set the record straight they had a they had a very well-designed study case-controlled same age peers matched so girls and and and adult women with type one age match two girls and adult women without type one and they found that the diabetes group had two and a half times the risk of developing an eating disorder than the same age matched group so that's pretty compelling research bill Polanski is one of the shoulders that I stand on actually he and Barbara Anderson at Joslin Diabetes Center back in the 90s collected some some really interesting interesting survey data looking at eating disorder symptoms and depression and anxiety and overall specific diabetes distress and then created their own survey specifically asking about some eating disorder traits and thoughts and beliefs that might be unique to people with type 1 diabetes they gave these surveys out to just women with type 1 who happened to be in our medical waiting room they weren't they weren't hand selected for having a mental health appointment in fact they were all there for just routine medical care and look at the age range thirteen to sixty years old so this is not the age range that we typically think of when we think of eating disorders and 31% at the esteemed Joslin Diabetes Center admitted that they omitted insulin at some point in their lives now that is not to say that 31% of these women met diagnostic criteria for eating disorders that is to say that 31% of these women openly acknowledged that they were willing to really play a very dangerous gamble in an attempt to lose weight at certain points in their lives a similar gamble to the kinds of crazy things that women are willing to do when they buy those medicine and those they're supplements out of the back of fashion magazines you know they're not FDA approved ephedra it's whatever who knows who-who do or something there's some new I don't know crazy stuff you know and they always have a hoodia is that it okay and they always sorry not a cool do and their so it it just sounds like voodoo that's why and there's always you know the before and after where the before the woman's really sad and pale and pasty white and after she's tan and gorgeous and you can't even recognize her because she's been airbrushed but um so I think that's what's going on with this 31% nine percent admitted to using this symptom at a level of frequency that probably merited any new suitors diagnosis I'm using all of these very cagey sort of half-hearted terms like probably and maybe because we can't say that this was a questionnaire serving but we're estimating that and then in ninety seven and again in 2005 we've got papers in the New England Journal of Medicine and in diabetes care showing really once and for all that that these symptoms are associated with earlier onset of micro vascular complications at both younger age and shorter duration of diabetes and so showing really that the eating disorders in the context of type one diabetes cosmetical damage and then I looked at the same group of women the 341 Joslin patients that bill and Barbara gave those questionnaires to my colleague Katie and Kitty Wanger and I decided let's let's try to track these women down and and we're pretty proud of ourselves actually because it was not designed originally as a longitudinal study and so you know thirteen to sixty so a lot of these women got married you know in that time period a lot of these women changed their names a lot of them were college students in Boston moved elsewhere in the country we were able to track down 60% of them and we found that admitting to restricting insulin at some point in your life conveyed a three-fold increased risk of death during the 11-year follow-up period that's really really chilling data and so that's the paper insulin restricted and the insulin restriction and associated morbidity and mortality and women with type 1 diabetes and my goal really in in getting that getting that message out there was to sort of end the debate and to really highlight yeah this is a high-stakes problem for this is a women's health issue this kills women and we got to do something about it and let's stop the kind of research that's focused on is it or isn't it and if so does it matter let's move the field forward to some treatment research and some prevention research which is what we which is what we really need at this time so we found 60 percent of the original cohort and they were categorized as insulin restrictors this is important so this is not to say that they actually had an eating disorder we can't say that because this is just questionnaire data they answered a question for us that said I take less insulin than I should and if they said yes to it we called them an insulin restrictor that could be at any level of frequency and we called them an insulin restrictor and that crude kind of question still differentiated those two categories and showed such a higher risk of mortality there was no difference in rates of death so the the non insulin restricting group and the and the insulin restricting group they had similar death rates but the average age of those who died who were in the insulin restriction category was quite a bit younger so 44 verses 58 and 40 percent this tells you something about frequency and severity of the symptoms 40% of deceased insulin restrictors versus 7% of living insulin restrictors endorsed that they did it always so it's a you know so really was a more severe group but that's sort of the the compromise that we were able to come at it to try to figure out diagnostically was there something meaningful about frequency and severity so really where I want to spend the time is how do we recognize these these phenomena earlier and when we do recognize them what do we actually do about it so what I'm gonna give you or some sort of diagnostic sort of clues and and again I'm calling them clues because there are many reasons why people may may have a dramatic change in their weight up or down there are many reasons why people may have a change in their a1c up or down it doesn't mean that that is the smoking gun of an eating disorder right just a couple clues to sort of raise your you're questioning but but there could be multiple factors at play you have to be alert to falsified blood glucose data but again that's a very common behavior in teenagers with type 1 diabetes that's the reason why blood sugar meters have memory right I mean so we know that so that that again is not a ha the meter doesn't you know the the handwritten glucose law doesn't match the a1c that person has an eating certain no and I want you guys to start thinking you know more in more nuanced ways there's multiple reasons why somebody may be having a harder time managing their diabetes but this is a unique thing note patterns have repeated unexplainable DKA again that could be a marker of chaos in the family that could be a marker homelessness and lack of medical care or that could be a marker of an eating disorder inquire about irregular menstrual periods again it's not a diagnostic perfection yes no but oftentimes if women are running higher sugars in a chronic enough way they'll skip their menses and this is really the take home message I think so often family members friends coaches and particularly medical professionals are afraid to ask these kinds of questions so for a number of reasons first of all everyone's afraid of somehow teaching this symptom right and I think that's valid like we we have to ask these things in a more open-ended insensitive way but but I think another thing is it's sort of like when I was in my internship training and doing evaluations in the emergency room and you'd have to ask questions about suicidality and you'd sort of at the same time be closing your ears and going please say no please say no and you know you have to ask it's really important so so you have to ask how do you feel about your weight shape and body are you trying to lose weight are you currently dieting do you follow a meal plan is it hard to follow the meal plan but bottom line do you ever adjust your insulin in order to affect your weight that's a very kind of neutral I haven't said up-down weight up down I've done nothing or just asked the question we actually asked in the study do you take less insulin than you should now here's the problem with all of these questions everybody can say no to them right and they can look you in the eye and say absolutely not something's wrong with my strips the meter conked out I have no idea what's going on something's wrong with that lab that gave me the a1c but by starting the conversation you guys are showing that you're open to it that you know about it and that you want to know about it instead of sort of having this kind of like you're not taking less insulin than you should write which you know the answer of course to that is no so what I found myself doing I I Jocelyn's a really strange place to work actually because in some ways my role is that of sort of traditional psychotherapist I see some people who are local I can actually see them with sort of pretty regular frequency but then we've got these patients who come to us because they've heard you know we're the best place in the world and so they come to us from Venezuela or from Saudi Arabia or wherever and it's a one-shot deal you know it's like meet the whole team in two days have one hour with an global Fabri and be done with your eating disorder and you know that'll be great if I could figure that out cuz the HMOs would love me but the so what I've started doing in in those kind of single-shot consultations is I kept drawing this model for people because I felt like I wanted them to have something they could take home to their medical team at home to start the conversation and if you if you've ever seen a sort of proposed model of eating disorders in general or frankly any psychiatric problem the the precursor the top box is always something biopsychosocial so it's always something genetic or by a lot neurochemical [Music] something wrong in the family system there's abuse there's trauma there's who knows what something social there's disenfranchisement from society there's women's role in society there's the media influence there's blah blah blah blah blah and I'm not trying to belittle these things but in diabetes where I have to start is the treatment so the diabetes treatment goals themselves teach or have the potential to teach to a particularly vulnerable some of this eating disorders mindset right so we're emphasizing the importance of near-normal glycaemia we need to emphasize that that is important but if you're giving that message to someone who's already an extreme perfectionist they're going to take that ball and run with it and get very very frustrated we're teaching carbohydrate counting which I actually think is a pretty reasonable tool but the way that gets sort of translated through the mind of a vulnerable person who's already thinking about weight loss and dieting and already has some very rigid ideas about good foods and bad foods I think can get morphed and in a certain way we do advocate portion control and dietary restraint and we have to but I think it's sort of how do we make this message a little bit more reasonable then we have to own up to the fact that intensive insulin management actually does run the risk of weight gain then you've got the extreme perfectionism and frustration that can emerge with blood glucoses that don't sort of map into that perfect 80 to 120 range and frustration with weight and then you've got sort of the feelings of deprivation dietary restrain and possibly the emergence of a binge purge cycle so on the left hand side you've got symptoms of depression on the right hand side negative feelings about weight and shape and then at the bottom this sort of cycle of hyperglycemia elevated a1c strategic insulin restriction for calorie purging and for some people it's not symptoms of depression for some people it's symptoms of anxiety who knows we can you know tailor that to the individual but I found this model to be very helpful to actually review with patients and to try to say okay here's what I think has been going on and where are you ready to start to try to tackle this because I used to feel incredibly overwhelmed by the complexity of this and how everything intersects and overlaps and hyperglycemia feels a lot like depression and you know the lethargy that goes with that and the irritability and how do you dissect one from the other and all this stuff and all this murkiness and at one point I had this kind of aha experience where I realized okay it is very complicated and in a certain way that's actually freeing because if you if your psyche psychologically trained there's this other theory called family Systems Theory and the idea is the system is its own thing and everything influences everything else and one change in one family member changes the whole system and so one change anywhere in this complex web has the potential to sort of tip the balance and move things forward or at least jostle things a little bit and so that's how I try to sort of pitch it to my patients this is a completely fake person she doesn't exist we are gonna get into some actual real quotes from from people but Tara is sort of like a mishmash of probably I don't know sixty a hundred patients for the sake of argument she's fifteen and a half years old she's had type one since she was six and this is gonna sound very familiar to you guys at age twelve right around the onset of puberty her blood Sugar's get a lot harder to manage right this this is typical with all the hormonal changes of puberty that the hormones actually act as insulin agonists and so you have a much harder to manage diabetes during puberty and right at the point where it's developmentally appropriate that a kid like Tara should one less parental supervision and less parental involvement in her diabetes management and her reasonably well-meaning parents are trying to let her individuate and are trying to let her become a little bit more sort of with her management she's got a much harder to manage diabetes so everyone's pulling back a little and diabetes is worse so there's less support for a harder disease and she gets frustrated so along with that frustration comes the occasional skipped blood sugar check and comes the occasional skipped insulin injection which who the hell wouldn't skip it it's one more irritation and positive comments start happening as she's losing weight and before we realized that her a1 C's are climbing higher so she's got this added bonus of not having as many hassles because she's taking a couple of shots and there's this incredibly reinforcing and very very powerful phenomenon that she's that she's seeing incredibly fast and incredibly dramatic weight loss on the scale and she's eating whatever she wants and then the rubber hits the road because she gets her a1c drawn and there's all kinds of conflict and and kind of like not only within the family but also conflict within the medical team and some disengagement from health care and now we're in really big trouble so on the left-hand side you see weight and the yellow bar is her weight and on the right hand side you see a1c in the red bars her a1c and I actually do this with patients and I found this to be most helpful I don't do this with every patient but I found it to be most helpful with the kind of folded sholde folded arms I don't know nothing kind of responds teenager do you know these kids how's your diabetes going I don't know what do you want to talk about nothing right well why are you here I don't know people think I'm crazy put me in the shrinks office so and I'll just sort of this worked a lot better when we had a paper chart but so flipped through and we'd actually draw this kind of timeline and we'd sort of map it on to so what was going on when you were 12 when that a1c started going up what was going on in your family how did you feel about diabetes at that point and and sometimes this is a conversation starter or gosh look at the inverted relationship between your 14% a1c at age 13 and that really really low weight how'd you feel and you know and then you start to see over time maybe the relationship becomes less clear so this is where it starts to get really murky and you actually do see this a lot that you can have the high a one C but the eating becomes so voracious because of the high sugars and the actual sort of cellular bodily starvation that's going on that people can eat in such a dysregulated way that even the high blood sugars don't maintain very very low weight and so sometimes you start to get this sort of disconnect between the high sugars and the weight and so you see that a little bit with Tara and you and you also see the two episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis which is the profound risk for for most of my patients and and for most young women or women of all ages who are struggling with this problem so I thought it would help serve enliven the the discussion to actually look at the way some patients actually talk about this problem and this is not my patient this is a woman named JJ who was the patient at the Joslin and actually was one of the study participants in that in the study that that I did the follow up to Bill Polanski and Barbara Anderson's research and JJ died at age 24 and her mother volunteered at the Joslin and learned about my research and has been very very involved in in supporting this work and and in you know trying to get the word out about this problem and so she's been willing to speak with Boston Globe and USA Today and CNN and another other media outlets when when they asked me can you you know give me a patient to talk to I never give a patient to talk to but she's been willing to tell her own daughter's story and and she gave me JJ's diary and this is a quote that actually was in The Boston Globe so I feel comfortable sharing it with you guys I know it's not a lot of weight but twelve pounds in two weeks is drastic and uncomfortable this is right at the point where JJ was trying to take better care of herself so she was she was giving herself insulin and she was getting some of that swelling that happens that insulin edema that happens when your body goes from profound dehydration to to rehydration so I know it's not a lot of weight but 12 pounds in two weeks is drastic and uncomfortable I haven't taken my insulin now for a day and a half I feel too fat hopefully by tomorrow I'll feel thinner and have the strength to continue my insulin program and she signs this particular diary entry with her weight and in a day and a half it's four pounds lighter than that twelve pound weight gain so you can see again this is very dramatic and an incredibly reinforcing behavior and then JJ's mom wrote it's become clear to me that the message I've conveyed you will die but that's not the worst thing that will happen is not helpful to women who are actively practicing this behavior I think that I should change my message to don't start because you may not be able to stop as a result I believe that awareness and Prevention is just as important an issue as treatment of insulin restriction itself and again I completely agree and I think this is another area that we really need to start paying attention to but at the very least early intervention and early detection is possible if more clinicians are willing to sort of have that conversation with patients this actually is a patient's story of a lasting recovery I began to change slowly I had learned over the years that any action that needs to be done for the rest of my life must fit into it I'd finally made a change in my life and sustained it and it felt good actually it felt incredible so I chose to make another change and then another and these changes soon add it up and now I'm happily living the benefits of my concerted efforts and I love this quote because if you think about incremental changes along the way that's exactly what we actually need to encourage our patients to be willing to try and that's exactly the treatment tactic that I'll talk about when we get to the next slides and it's actually what the DCCT data show us right so they show that with every one point decrease in a1c you shave off risk of complications and so rather than fixating totally on 7% or below as this sort of diabetes nirvana I think what we have to focus on with these patients in particular but probably with most patients is incremental change and moving forward and how much better their bodies feel when they move from 10 percent to 9 or from 9 to 8 as she goes on with improving my blood Sugar's blood lipids and blood pressure came significant and considerable benefit my kidney function went from full-blown clinical albuminuria to normal function my feet which used to be virtual ice icebergs now maintain healthy warmth I had sustained proliferative retinopathy and in 1997 had laser surgery on my eyes my ophthalmologist told has told me for the past consecutive six years that not only are my eyes not getting worse they are healing and improving and we actually seen this this is not just one woman's story that she happens to articulate it in a really great way but so I think that's the message that that we need to be able to convey to patients and that's somehow the message that has gotten lost in the DC CT data actually so when we talk about treatment of eating disorders one of the gurus happens to be this guy dr. Christopher Fairburn he created this cognitive behavioral therapy primarily aimed at bulimia nervosa but now it's aimed at all eating disorders and what he starts with is establishing regular and flexible eating patterns and eliminating dieting and food restriction so he starts right there and woody and what he actually articulates is have a planned breakfast lunch and dinner and snacks in between don't allow yourself to become so deprived that advantage gets triggered and if you flashback to the old style meal planning that we used to give as education to patients with type 1 it sounds actually very similar and it turns out if you give your body some nutrients across time across the day while you're physically active your blood sugars are somewhat smoother and you're less triggered to binge and so that's the fundamental starting point that I try to work with my patients on at least from the meal planning perspective and frankly I don't really Karen he doesn't care either what they're eating for those meals so in the beginning we just start with let's have meals and then we get into more of the nuances but initially it's about let's establish a routine and then we also talk about developing healthier means of coping that negative emotions addressing some of the depression and anxiety that goes with that and decreasing perfectionism and black-and-white thinking and what he doesn't do because he doesn't treat diabetes is he doesn't apply that to blood glucose but I sure as hell do and I think that that's really important and so we talked about you know trying to really use one of the strategies I use a lot is instead of focusing on the individual number I have my patients once they are actually taking some blood sugar checks I have my patients look at the 30 day and the 14 day average on their meters so a couple of the meters only give you a 14 day in the seven day but most of them will give you a 30 and a 14 and a seven and so you'll be able to actually see incremental progress over time and so and sometimes that incremental progress is just the end so you'll see the number gosh so last week you went from seven checks in seven days to 14 checks that's great you know sometimes it requires that kind of distance not evaluating the numbers themselves but just the the actual frequency of checking and I mean obviously twice daily checking is not the ultimate goal but we're looking at incremental movement and so then I'll focus also on you know gee if you look at your 30-day average it was 350 but your seven-day is 250 so look at what's actually happened and the a1c isn't even gonna reflect tremendous change yet because it's 30 days so you know trying to take sort of a smaller picture in a way a smaller picture than the a1c but a bigger picture than the individual blood sugar number itself so I think that's actually a helpful tool so when we look at the research on cognitive behavioral therapy in in eating disorders outside of diabetes what we see is average symptom reduction of 75% so that's not a cure but that's quite a bit a symptom reduction and abstinence rates are modest at best with an average of 40% so we have to move forward that's not where we want to end up it means people are still struggling with this for years and years but the combination of cognitive behavioral therapy with psycho farm so with antidepressant treatments or some mood stabilizing treatments or anti-anxiety medications is more powerful than either of those alone and and what's interesting and what hasn't been studied is the combination of improved blood sugars so if you think about the mood impact that improved blood sugars have no one studied if we don't even use psychopharmacology if we just aim at improving blood sugars and the cognitive behavioral therapy what happens then there probably is some neuro chemical and and an other impact that we could show but we haven't been able to study it yet so there are very few treatment outcome studies of eating disorders and diabetes at this time in fact there's one and I'm going to tell you a little bit about it but it's sort of this weird hybrid kind of study it's it's a great study I don't mean to to knock it at all it's it's the first of its kind but but in it intended to be a treatment study and actually what I think it proved itself to be as a prevention study so what they took this is the group in Toronto again they took 85 women with type 1 and I should actually say young women so ages 12 to 20 and they randomly assigned these these young women to six weeks of group psychoeducation on eating disorders and diabetes and one of their parents needed to come as well and they ran separate tracks so they had six weeks of psychoeducation groups for the girls with type 1 themselves and then on the same night but in a separate group parents attended a similar kind of intervention and then they compared that to treatment as you and what they found was that they were able to decrease self-reported dieting and body dissatisfaction and they were able to decrease what they call the drive for thinness which is actually just a portion of a questionnaire that's a diagnostic questionnaire for eating disorders in the PE group he is psychoeducation but there was no difference in binge episodes or insulin emission rates or a1c and they actually stacked the deck against themselves so these guys are really really interested in prevention and so there were very few women in this sample who even said that they did take less insulin than they should so it's hard to change the symptom that they're not owning up to yet so there's some kind of trickiness and the in in the cohort but when you look at the bottom point the a1c level was the primary pretreatment difference between what they called responders and non-responders so going into the six-week intervention six-month wait ya know six weeks one month follow-up and then six months all up excuse me going into that intervention people who improved in terms of their dieting their body dissatisfaction and their drive for thinness had an average a1c of 8.2 and people who didn't improve who were considered non-responders had an average a1c of 10.2 so I would say the horse is already out of the barn for the 10.2% and what they did is they actually crafted some form of a prevention study and and so I think there there's tons we need to do that that moves beyond this but but it certainly has something to show and and I'm really pleased that there's at least some attempt at treatment so that so the treatment that I that I most most advocate for is first of all early detection and early intervention because we know from the eating disorders literature in general that the best prognosis is with the shortest duration and the Toronto Group would would advocate even for subclinical so intervention at a subclinical level so even before you're at the eating disorder NOS kind of category when you're just maybe a teenage girl who has some body image concerns that's where that group would advocate we've got a we've got to intervene because this is such a high-risk situation in type 1 diabetes the patient in the kind of work I do takes a very active role in treatment and so she defines what she wants to focus on first so if she since so if you think back to that model if she's interested in first and foremost targeting the blood Sugar's then we start with how are we going to increase frequency of blood sugar monitoring if she wants to focus on improving the depression I get her an appointment with a psychiatrist and we start on psycho farm if she wants to start with her binge eating we start right there where I talked about with sort of creating an eating routine and establishing that first and foremost and oftentimes they don't know where they're gonna start and so I just sort of throw these ideas out and we do a little bit of everything but the treatment requires a multidisciplinary team I'm really really lucky because I work in a building where that already exists so I've got you know the endocrinologist the nurse educator the dietician the exercise physiologist all of whom I can refer to and I even have a psychiatrist which is fabulous so so we've got that multidisciplinary team it's a lot harder when you don't have that and I certainly do get referrals from patients who get their medical care elsewhere and they're just coming to Joslin to see me and that's just a lot harder though they'll get monthly medical and nurse educator appointments and sometimes weekly dietician appointments right at the beginning I happen to work with one dietician specifically so she and I think similarly and I'm we sort of you know have similar philosophies and so that works very nicely regular lab and wait checks that done obviously by the medical team and and and I don't do treatment unless it's already understood that all of us are communicating and talking about things regularly and if the patient isn't open to that then I can't treat that person treatment goals are established again through this collaborative kind of kind of effort and and I think that's really important part of the reason why it's so important to have open communication between team members is that you want to all have the same message right so if I'm talking about incremental changes but the endocrinologist and this is just to pick a straw man as the endocrinologist not that they're bad people but if that person is focused on 7% a1c or nothing we're talking two different languages and so we're not a treatment team so we have to sort of start to develop a similar philosophy the goals are small and incremental and attainable so think about that woman who talked about her lasting recovery she served tick two little pieces along the way and the DCCT goals are not the goals for these patients yet we're not moving from a 14% a1c to a 7% a1c it's just not reasonable and actually it's not safe so I had a patient who did that because she was so hell-bent on not seeing the shrink again that she was referred to me as a 16 year old with an a1c of 14 and a month later she had an a1c of 7 and every and everyone was terrified and immediately rushed her to an eye exam because they were so scared that they had you know duck created some sort of havoc luckily she was absolutely fine but we try not to make moves like that because it's actually far too harsh on the body and not realistic she's now a very long-standing patient of mine and it's been a long journey so you have to find a goal that you can all agree on and mentally focus on both the regularity of insulin dosing the regularity of blood glucose monitoring and again the regularity of establishing an eating pattern in a way I should have focused on this first my initial hurdle though is that for the people who are in recurrent risk of diabetic ketoacidosis that is my starting point so if they're if they've had you know multiple decays that's the first order of business I can't do treatment if the risk is they're going to be in the intensive care next week so so I try to get buy-in right there and and so okay you know we're going to establish the first goal of treatment is you're going to be willing to take your basal insulin with regularity because in order for us to even start treatment we need to know that medically or at least safe-ish if you know what I mean and so we discuss what the signs of DKA are because a lot of times these women have symptoms of DKA or symptoms of ketosis not necessarily a full-blown ketoacidosis and they attributed to other things and they just sort of drink extra water and move on I had one patient who herself was a physician and and her a 1c I believe when she started with me was 18 and she was drinking a gallon of water every two hours to try to flush the ketones and basically I mean that's an extremely unusual circumstance but she was functioning sort of as her own intensive care unit so then we have to establish what are the common hurdles of the initial phase of treatment and JJ gave us a clue in in that diary entry so consumed edema is really where my brother is actually right and this problem really is diabolical because at the very very start of treatment you're taking a patient population who is a cutely concerned with how tight the waistband of their pants are how puffy their ankles are how puffy their cheeks are etc etc and you're actually giving them puffiness right you're giving them water retention and they perceive that as fat because the number on the scale has gone up and in fact their skin feels tight I mean they really feel uncomfortable it's a horrible feeling and so we have to talk about that before any change even starts because if I don't talk about that I'm never going to see them again so I would advocate that we need to start talking about that with most people when they're in intensive care for DKA I mean not when they're in intensive care but once they've become medically stabilized and can actually talk with us we need to explain to them what that weight gain was all about and why their body feels so uncomfortable and how they're gonna get through that by actually allowing themselves to maintain appropriate hydration and maintain reasonably healthy blood sugars so that they can get through that to the end of that tunnel the other thing that's really diabolical is the enlarged or fatty liver so you do have patients because they've had such prolonged exposure to high sugars they actually have fatty liver and their liver is actually swollen and even though they're relatively quite thin their abdomen is distended because of this enlarged organ and I had a patient just recently where she she actually was at an art festival where some for some reason they had massage therapists and and the massage therapist said oh we're pregnant and she's like sunk into the floor so it is visibly noticeable and and so we have to acknowledge that for some of these patients there's actually not a distorted body image there is something that's changed in their bodies - glycaemia is another trigger so again some of these patients are profoundly afraid of hypoglycemia partly because they're afraid of hypoglycemia it's a horrible thing but partly because they're afraid of having to eat to treat hypoglycemia and in the state of hypoglycemia many many patients we'll talk about over treating their lows because there's this sort of frenzy of if some is good more is going to do the trick and how do I just get this feeling to go away and that can feel a lot like a binge to someone who actually is a binge eater and so that can also be quite triggering and then one of the things where I really rely on my medical colleagues is that to try to sort the way I teach this to patients is you know because of hyperglycemia there's a situation where their bodies have glucose toxicity right so they're not actually able to utilize their insulin as effectively so the amount of insulin that it takes to serve yank those numbers down into a healthier range is a lot more insulin than will be needed to maintain healthier numbers and patients get that if you explain it to them and they'll sort of have this aha like oh yeah that's why I gained so much weight when I came out of the hospital because I never had that adjustment within the first few weeks or first first month that you know they break through the glucose toxicity and they really need to sort of take less insulin but in a guided way by a medically trained person to help them avoid having to eat toward their insulin dose so that that's huge another really important thing is to address perfectionism and I would say that's that's almost as big a problem with with the patient as it is with with the multidisciplinary medical team we all have perfectionism we know that this is a high-stakes disease and and we know that you know that the clock is ticking and complications are real and so we've we've got to sort of keep out of our own way by not getting so perfectionistic that we lose sight of the incremental changes that patients are making because those changes are real and they're important and so we have to set realistic blood glucose goals and realistic self-care goals we know that depression and anxiety are at higher rates in type 1 diabetes happens to be at higher rates and type 2 as well so we have to be alert to that as as a potential complicating factor and and we want to treat that with all the tools in our arm and armamentarium we know that treatments work I mean these are highly treatable problems and so typically I try to sort of D stigmatize the idea of psycho farm by by talking about the higher rates in in type one and saying hey you know this is a very common struggle for people with type 1 diabetes and then the fear is yeah but if I take the medicine is it going to make me cause wait because is it going to make me gain weight and so you have to be able to know that you're referring to a psychiatrist who's sensitive to that issue and who's going to pick relatively weight neutral medications and then of course this is sort of the psychotherapeutic aspect that I work on more once we've got some of these other symptoms settled down which is to talk about safer coping strategies when when people are feeling triggered to either binge or purge or under dose or engage in or Cal restrict engage in all these behaviors so so that's sort of the longer-term aspect once some of the dust has settled and I believe that that's it sense of self is defined by their body image and there's no that you know there's you can never be too rich or too thin they can never be too thin eating-disorder nos nos means not otherwise specified this is actually where about 75% of patients with eating disorders land diagnostically and if you look at the eating disorders research it's all this very squeaky-clean academic research where it's looking at pure categories of anorexia nervosa pure categories of bulimia nervosa and not this sort of slightly blurry hodgepodge of it's a really low weight person but occasionally she binges and maybe she purchased sometimes but not at the same level of frequency and it served runs the risk did this is where the majority of patients actually are but by calling it nos not otherwise specified sort of implies that it's this not really clinical category and it's it's absolutely not true eating disorders are very medically compromising and they are that whether they're nos or bulimia or anorexia so here's the prevalence and this is outside the area of diabetes anorexia nervosa affects between 0.5 and 1% of late adolescent and adult women I mostly speak about women actually during this talk because we'll get to it a little bit later but the ratio of women to men with eating disorders is 10 to 1 so the majority of patients are in fact women bulimia nervosa is twice the rate of anorexia between one and two percent and then here's the edge nos is what they call it eating disorder not otherwise specified which is again you'll see at a much higher rate and that's only in college aged women ten percent but again there used to be this idea in the eating disorder scientific literature that this was primarily an adolescent and young adult woman woman's problem and what we've learned it's more like a chronic vulnerability that follows women into adulthood and into middle adulthood and probably until dur adulthood as well so approximately a thousand women die annually of anorexia nervosa it's the most lethal psychiatric disorder that that exists over five million Americans have eating disorders and 15% of young women have what's called substantially disordered eating sort of the the mythology that this is a sexy sort of spectacular Hollywood fabulous kind of lifestyle and I think what's missing there is that this is actually a psychiatric disease which causes tremendous pain and heartache and massive torment to the person and their family members and their loved ones and and major major medical medical problems so these are the women who have intense fear of gaining weight even though they're already at an at a very low body weight and and actually have sort of distortion in their self image where what they're seeing in the mirror is something actually very different than what we're seeing when we're looking at them so they can coin and show you you know I have fat right here I have fat right here and they perceive themselves very differently than how we're actually seeing them it also happens to have the absence of at least three consecutive menstrual cycles because the body the female body at such a low weight is not a safe body to have a pregnancy so body sort of preserves energy and and doesn't have a menstrual cycle bulimia nervosa is very very connected in the underlying thought process and the underlying sense of self that women with anorexia struggle with but but bulimia nervosa these women are typically either normal weight or slightly Oh wait and so these are actually the unseen unrecognized people who are struggling with an eating disorder and this is actually where the majority of patients with type one male and diagnostically but we'll talk about that a little bit more so this is where their recurrent episodes of binge eating which is very different than the kind of eating you guys are doing right now been shaving is defined as eating a larger amount than your than your peers would but it has to be accompanied by a sense of loss of control and so there's this psychological aspect to it that it feels like chemical reaction has started and the person is completely out of control of the behavior and I think the question that that this rule that this particular little piece of the diagnosis really really begs is what is the same one diabetes and I'm mostly going to be talking about type 1 because that's where my research is although I do do a lot of work with eating issues and weight issues in type 2 so I'm happy to answer questions about that as well but this phenomenon is primarily understood in type 1 and and has to do with the intentional manipulation of insulin doses for the purposes of weight loss through hyperglycemic calorie purging so women and girls intentionally skip insulin shots or underdose insulin shots run their Sugar's high and lose the majority of their calories in their urine through glycosuria so what I'm going to do tonight is talk to you about eating disorders in general I haven't found a sort of a pissy or way of explaining that so I call it eating disorders in general because what I mean is eating disorders not in the world of diabetes and then I'll talk also about some possible connections between eating disorders and type 1 diabetes and the talk primarily focusing on case examples and treatment strategies that I've found helpful and hopefully we can discuss of your own cases because I think that's really where the rubber hits the road and where people are more interested so I just have this little disclaimer at the beginning which is that the connections between eating disorders and diabetes that I will be discussing are primarily derived from my own theorizing but strongly informed by the research and writing of my colleagues in Toronto doctors Gary Rhoden and Patricia Colton and Marian Olmstead who are really the leaders in this field my discussion of treatment strategies will be rooted in research on eating disorders outside the context of diabetes naively created clinical interpretation witchcraft and Voodoo because largely we don't know how to treat this population and so the task at hand is really to look at the eating disorders research and the eating disorders treatment research and try to understand ok how do we take what's known and understood about treating eating disorders and uniquely tweak those those strategies to tailor them to the specific needs of women with type 1 so anorexia nervosa is the refusal to maintain body weight at or above minimally normal weight so these are the sort of classic stereotype when you think of eating disorders to see this very emaciated waif-like image anytime I'm in the airport I see these on all the tabloid magazines the latest Hollywood starlets struck down by an eating disorder and it actually has you so we're gonna be talking about eating disorders and diabetes today and how many of you have heard the term diable amina okay two years ago maybe one person would have raised their hand and I've been doing this work for about ten years seeing patients primarily treating women and and teenage girls with this problem but I had this strange experience where Joslin Diabetes Center as bill said because we're pretty well-known in the area we get a lot of publicity calls and sort of journalists call us and ask you know we have a communications department will you please speak to so-and-so about whatever and they know that I pretty much will talk to anybody about anything and so they always filled anything that has anything remotely to do with emotions they throw my way and this one actually happened to be about my area so I was even more excited but the guy I somehow missed something and the guy was asking me for like a local Florida story like did I did I know any patients in Florida who were struggling with this and so somehow I thought it was like a local newspaper story in Florida and it turned out it was this and he actually works for The Associated Press wire service and a day after it was published it was on 900,000 newspapers across the world actually and so I sort of had the funny experience of googling myself and I was in China and these very strange things so so the term diable emia as I hope you know is actually a term that's been created by the press it's not a term that I really agree with and it's it's actually a term that I have some issues with because number one my brother makes fun of me about it because he thinks it sounds like diabolical and what kind of nonsense is that I'm not real doctor I'm only a PhD he has so he just likes to throw that around and and also because I think it runs the risk actually of reducing this problem to one problem when in fact what it is is two very distinct chronic diseases namely an eating disorder and type what is the peer group when you're talking about someone with type 1 diabetes how do you define a binge in the context of type 1 diabetes is that any deviation from the meal plan is it over treating a hypoglycemic episode is it eating the same as your same age peers without diabetes but that's actually overeating for them but it's binging for you because your blood sugars go higher it's totally confusing I think in this particular arena and so we don't really know how to define binge eating in type 1 but connected to that there has to be calorie purging and in bulimia nervosa most typically what people think of is self induced vomiting or possibly laxative abuse maybe compulsive over-exercising but the area for type 1 diabetes in the early 80s you started to see a lot of research that was basically an academic debate between psychiatry and this sort of very categorized diagnostic criteria and people who were actually treating women with type 1 who we're saying we've got these women who are running their Sugar's high they're running all sorts of medical risks developing complications early they have an eating disorder and psychiatry was saying no no no they don't because it can't be purging it's not vomiting it's not laxative abuse it's not a compulsive exercise and it's not until DSM 4 which is only two DSM's ago which is our Diagnostic and Statistical Manual that they actually included the misuse other medications as a symptom of bulimia nervosa and so in other chronic disease states like thyroid disease you have a manipulation of thyroid medicine in other disease states like cystic fibrosis you have manipulation of the pancreatic enzymes as a means of calorie purging and and in our case with type 1 selectively or intentionally under dosing or even skipping insulin doses to produce hyperglycemia for the purpose of calorie wasting into the urine and so then you get into the sort of person that giddy has to happen this many times per week in order to count as a diagnosis but what's really fundamentally similar is that whether you're talking about anorexia or bulimia or any kind of eating disorder these are women whose	Low Medical Info

week's video i'm gonna be talking about my chronic kidney disease i know my last video on gastroparesis was really long so i'm gonna try to make this one a little shorter and just a little more to the point um I had a lot of information to share about gastroparesis and I feel like kidney disease a little is a little more common maybe a little more well known so I'm not gonna share as many of the details I'll just tell a little bit more about me specifically um so basically like I said before I have diabetes diabetes really causes a lot of problems in the body diabetes caused my retinopathy the trouble with my eyes it caused my gastroparesis and now it is also caused what is called chronic kidney disease um which basically means I am you know it's also referred to as kidney failure I am I'm almost a 10 stage renal disease which is there's four stages to canoes ease and I'm kind of on the borderline between stage 3 and stage 4 so we we already have had meetings about transplant and talking about dialysis and things like that but I have not started dialysis yet or anything like that so basically what has happened is the issues that I had with gastroparesis the vomiting which in turn leads to dehydration has put an incredible strain on my kidneys every time I get hospitalized because of the gastroparesis I'm usually dehydrated and then they would pump me full of fluid and once I got out of the hospital then they would have to give me pills to help me get rid of the fluid because there was just so much I literally I would go in the hospital for a week and when I came out of the hospital I would weigh sometimes 60 pounds more than when I went into the hospital so you can imagine what that does to your kidneys doing that over and over and over again so over the course of the last few years I've been sick with gastroparesis for about a little over five years probably six years something like that so over the course of those five years or so just constantly being dehydrated you know pumping me full of fluid then taking the fluid off it just it really just destroyed my kidneys to the you know to the point that they just they can't recover anymore you know the sometimes they would they would show that they were being affected but then it would kind of come back again but that that just can't happen anymore so the kidney disease like I said the the biggest impact it's having right now is the fluid I retain a lot of fluid that's why I look like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man most days it also causes it causes me to have low iron so I've had to get iron infusions my vitamin D is low so I have to take vitamin D supplements my calcium is low it really just it affects a lot of parts of your bodies it makes me very tired actually the the kidney disease itself can actually cause nausea and vomiting as well so sometimes if I'm nauseous I don't know it's at the gastroparesis or is it the kidneys that's causing it there's really no way to tell so right now we we have started preparing for dialysis I just talked to my kidney doctor the last time I was there and she is hoping that perhaps I won't have to go on dialysis because they're finding that dialysis is so hard on the body that they really just don't want to do it unless I have to so you know we kind of we're thinking like hey we need to start dialysis so I can get rid of this fluid so I can feel better but what she explained to us is that in the long run the dialysis can actually like can weaken your body and so she just wants to put it off as long as she can and that it really made sense to me to do that but we're we're starting to get ready so that in case we have to do it we will be prepared because it could be that when when it comes time to start dialysis if we need to do that we might have to start suddenly you know it might it might be that I get really sick and while I'm in the hospital my kidneys just stopped and we might have to start dialysis so we want to be ready so the first thing that we have to do before they can do dialysis is I have to have an access point before the dialysis to be administered and that access point is actually going to be in the forearm now because of again all of the sickness that I've had my veins are shot when I go to the doctor and they try to draw blood it's horrible it's it's very difficult because my veins are just they I've always heard and been told that I have tiny veins and then on top of that they've been weakened and just used over and over again and it's just it's really hard for them to find a spot so what they do for dialysis is they put an access like I said they put an access point into your forearm into a vein but be my veins are so weak they had to make the veins stronger so I actually had a surgery I had this done in October of last year where they took an artery and the upper part of my arm and right here at the inside of the elbow they connected it to one of the veins that's in my forearm and so now the artery is supplying blood to that vein which is making the vein grow stronger and bigger and when it gets big enough then they will be able to put what they call a fistula into my forearm and that is where the dialysis will hook up and and go through the arm so I saw the surgeon last week and he said it's looking good they're gonna have to do another procedure now what they have to do is take the vein now that it's getting big enough they have to go in there and they have to lift the vein up so that it's nearer to the surface of the skin so I will be having to have another procedure done but he wants to put it off a little bit longer because when I had the initial surgery done the anesthesia made me extremely sick and I ended up in the hospital for something like three or four days or something like that so he's just wanting to wait a little bit longer before we do that next step so I have to go back in another six weeks and see where we are there so as far as avoiding dialysis the only other option other than dialysis is to get a kidney transplant now kidneys are the one organ that can be received from a live donor because everybody has two kidneys but you can survive with one kidney so I do actually have a family member I'm not gonna say who it is right now but I have a family member who is willing to donate a kidney and we have gone through the initial testing and they have said that this family member is a match but there is more testing that we need to do before they can determine if I can receive that kidney because another option that we can do is if if they think that that kidney is not a good good one for me this family member could donate a kidney and it could go to someone else and then I could possibly receive a kidney from another donor they they can cross match the donors so you know we're not we're not a hundred percent sure what's gonna happen there yet but we're going through that process of getting testing done and things like that the other thing is that I have some things that need to be done before I can be approved for a transplant and the main one is that I have a lot of dental work that needs to be done and that the majority of that has been caused by the gastroparesis that I have because I mean for a long time I was vomiting on probably a daily basis and that's a lot of acid on your teeth so all of my back teeth almost all of them I've got a few on the top on the right side but almost all of my back teeth we're just having to remove and then I've got a few cavities in in some of the other ones that are going to be filled but I have to have all of that done and then I just have to have a few a few other little things done but mostly the dental work once the dental work is done then what will happen is they will I have a transplant coordinator she will gather all of my information and put it all together we're going through Vanderbilt University Nashville for the transplant so she will take all of my information and all of my records you know all the documentation that they need like once my dental work is done I have to get a form signed by the dentist saying that everything's done and everything's okay and then she will take all that information and she has to present to my case to the transplant board and then they actually have to approve me to be able to receive a transplant so it's kind of a crazy process but you know we're trying we're just we're trying to get everything done and and see if we can move forward with this so you know there's a there's a good chance that I might be able to get a transplant this year and that would be really great we were told when we went we went for like an orientation for the transplant program they told us that the average kidney that is transplanted the average is that it lasts about eight to ten years but my kidney doctor actually told us that with you know improvements that are being made to the medicines and things like that that it's more like possibly 20 years now so that that would be wonderful if it would last 20 years we're gonna be doing some we're gonna have to do some fundraisers for the transplant once I get once you receive a transplant there are anti-rejection medicines that you have to take for the rest of your life one of the medications cost five thousand dollars for one month and when they said when we initially like when I initially receive the transplant when I'm ready to leave the Hospital we have to be prepared to pay for those medicines out of our own pocket when we leave the hospital you know justjust in case there's any issue with insurance or anything like that and I could I could only have to take one of those medicines I could have to take two I could have to take three and each one of them is several thousand dollars so we have to be prepared for that cost we also have to be prepared for travel expenses because Nashville is I can't think how far away it is right now but it's a couple of hours away from us my husband is going to have to take off work when I get ready to have the transplant because he is gonna have to be there with me and we don't know exactly for how long but with his job he does not get paid time off so anytime that he takes off it's going to be unpaid and we we will have no income so we're gonna be trying to come up with some fundraising ideas and some different things like that so I would love to hear from anyone that has any suggestions if you know of a fundraiser that somebody did you know I'd like I want to do something that would stand out that would be different from like a typical fundraiser maybe something some kind of fun activity or you know something like that we're thinking of probably doing some type of like a silent auction type of thing but let me know you know if you if you have any ideas if you've know of someone who has gone through this if you have gone through this or if you're going through it now leave me a comment let me know what it's like let me know what you've done let me know what someone else has done that you know of I would love to hear from you if you're new here I would love to have you subscribe to my channel I really want to build a community where we can we can talk about things you can ask me questions whatever you want I feel like I'm saying um a lot in this video I'm sorry I'm getting tired it's late at night so and there I go again I will see you in my next video I've got some more kind of fun videos planned coming up hopefully I all I've been making so far is just the videos talking about my health conditions I'm going to be filming a thrift haul pretty soon which actually may be up before I put this one up I'm not sure and I've got some like projects that I'm trying to film videos for so I would love to have you subscribe and be a part of this and you'll just be notified when I post a new video so again if you have suggestions for me

My OB doctor called and told me that I had failed the one-hour test for gestational diabetes, which absolutely shocked me. 



I passed the 1-hour glucose test (gestational diabetes) during my first pregnancy with ease, and I had been eating much healthier during this pregnancy. I never thought that I'd fail this test.


I had to schedule another appointment so that I could take the 3-hour glucose test, which required four blood draws, 8 hours of fasting, and more. The 3-hour glucose test was not fun at all, but it will help the doctors determine if you have gestational diabetes.


Watch the video to learn how that turned out, plus information on what it means if you fail the 3-hour glucose test.

it's sarah so in this pregnancy vlog i'm gonna talk about how i filled my 1-hour oral glucose-tolerance test so does that mean I have gestational diabetes well let's find out so when you're pregnant your OB provider will recommend that you take a glucose test and normally women will take this about 24 to 28 weeks depending on whatever your provider decides sometimes women take it earlier if they've had a history of it so at 26 weeks I had to take my one-hour glucose tolerance test and last pregnancy because it's my second pregnancy I passed with flying colors and did great and I was like yeah I'll take this test and you know I'm gonna pass well I got the phone call later that day that I felt and I was absolutely shocked that I failed because during this pregnancy I have actually been eating a lot healthier than I did with my first one so they called and my result was 146 the cutoff at that OB office is 130 it really varies depending on your OB office but I was 146 so I failed so if you've never taken the one-hour glucose test what it tells is that you have to be fasting mean you can't eat for about two hours before the test and you go there and you drink like this sugary concoction and there's various flavors I always get the fruit punch a lot of people don't like the drinks and they hate drinking it but to me it just tastes like a flat soda but anyways from the time you open up the bottle you only have five minutes to drink it and I normally drink it pretty fast so like less than one minute and then you have to wait an hour and then they draw your blood and they see how much glucose is in your blood now since I fell that one hour glucose test I had to take the three-hour glucose test and that's not exciting to do because it's long test so fortunately I was able to make that appointment with my regular other visit which was just in two weeks so I had to visit everything together and I really recommend if you have to do this that you do that so for this test the prep was a little bit different I had to be fasting so no food at least ten hours and my appointment was at 8:15 so if you have to do this do it in the morning time gets a little bit better so I quit eating at 8 o'clock that night got up went to the office I could only have water so I was drinking lots of water just to keep hydrated and the very first thing you have to do this time is that you have to get a blood draw there's a total of four blood draws for this test so you get a blood draw that's called the fasting one you don't have anything on your stomach so they're gonna see what your blood sugar was then you drink that liquid sugary concoction again and I think it has a little bit more sugar in it compared to the first one and you drink that you have to drink it within five minutes and then that's when the clock starts so I drunk that down pretty fast because I wanted to get this test over and so every hour from that time that I drunk that they would draw blood so I drunk it at 8:30 then at 9:30 that was my first straw then at 10:30 was my second draw and then 11:30 was my last straw and then I waited on my results so two days later they emailed me instead of calling which it's usually good I've noticed that if they email you rather than calling because it's usually better news and they emailed me and told me I had passed my test so that meant I did not have gestational diabetes and I was very very happy about that now to be diagnosed with gestational diabetes out of those four results that they're looking at two of them have to be abnormal so that wasn't the case with me and I'm very happy that it wasn't but I know that a lot of women are really freaked out about this test like whenever you fell your one hour like how I did I was shocked I did not think that that was gonna happen because it didn't happen with my first pregnancy and I was really nervous that I was going to get you know told I have gestational diabetes so if you do have that happen like what happened with me you fail your one hour now you have to take a three-hour don't stress because from what I have heard from my OB provider and other women this is very common that a lot of women fail that one hour but then they passed the three hour and I've even heard of women there one hour glucose tolerance test result being like in the 190s but they still pass so if you're in that situation right now just hold out hope that you know it things are gonna be okay but let's say you do get diagnosed with gestational diabetes first of all you need to know like it's not your fault don't blame yourself don't feel like a failure because I was already starting to feel like that whenever I spelled my one hour because really what's going on with this condition is the placenta is really causing you not to be able to use all that sugar so it's really hanging out in your blood and I have a whole video where I talk about gestational diabetes like what's going on on your in your body why you have it signs and symptoms and treatment those lab results and everything like that so if you do get that diagnosis I really recommend that you check that video out because I think it can help you understand what's going on in your body so I just wanted to give you all that update about what's going on and plus a really one to make this video for the women out there who are going to be searching you know I failed my one hour glucose tolerance test do I have diabetes what does this mean what's that three hour glucose test and just try to encourage you and let you know that yeah this happens and if you do get gestational diabetes what you need to do is just research what's going on with you and just be proactive about it and know that it's really not your fault you can blame your placenta so thank you all so much for watching and be sure to check out the other videos in my pregnancy vlog	High Medical Info

0fUG99bt9PQ	UCwEDMKTAocy8PPPJf46JXww	22.0	Type II Diabetes Mellitus Treatments II	"‚ÄúSo what do I take for this?‚Äù I‚Äôve heard that one a few times. In today‚Äôs society, whenever someone has a disease, we assume there is something we need to take for it. That is sometimes true for diabetes. Diabetes can be very severe or can be a fairly minor case. Some require just eating a bit better and getting some exercise, and their blood sugar will be just fine. Others run through multiple pills, taken together, and still can‚Äôt get their diabetes under control. They may graduate to high doses of insulin, and seemingly still only have partial control.

For those who require medicine, what can they take? This is a very complex question. Those who have very high blood sugars initially, sometimes we have to start with insulin. There are those who have to get their blood sugars under control, and they are so high, that insulin is the only way. Your physician will have to make that decision.

Most, however, can usually start with pills. Often, it may be a combination of medicines to get the blood sugars under control. There are many medications on the market today out there. With so many choices, any one patient may find themselves on any one of a number of different combinations of medicines. This isn‚Äôt an area of medicine with there is simply one right answer. What the physician has to find is a combination that works for the patient. A combination may be different from patient to patient, and an experienced physician will use the medications to help each other in order to try to achieve proper blood sugar control.

When it is deemed necessary for medication to be started, most physicians will begin with metformin, or Glucophage. It slows the liver‚Äôs process of making blood sugar and increases insulin sensitivity. It is usually well-tolerated, but can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea from time to time. It is inexpensive and taken once to three times daily.

Another common class of medications is the sulfonylureas. These include glipizide (Glucotrol), glimepiride (Amaryl) and glyburide. They used to be used very commonly, and are still out there. They are very inexpensive. They cause more insulin to be released from the pancreas‚Äô beta cells. They are considered to be fairly strong pills, do much so they can cause low blood sugars as a side effect. They also tend to wear out over time, and so therefore are not usually a lifelong drug.

Another formerly popular class of diabetes medications was the thiazolidinediones.  They increase insulin sensitivity in fat and muscle tissue, as well as the liver. They include pioglitazone (Actos) and rosiglitazone (Avandia). They do work relatively well, and have very few immediate side effects. They are slow to work, taking almost 2 to 3 months to show their results. There are thought to be associated rarely with bladder cancer, and Avandia was found to be associated with increased cardiovascular risk and inflammation of the liver. Because of these concerns, Avandia is seldom used, and patients who use these medications must have their urine monitored for any sign of blood in the urine that may be associated with bladder cancer.

A newer group of diabetic medications is called the DPP-4 inhibitors, which boost the effect of incretin, a hormone that helps make insulin. These include linagliptin (Tradjenta), saxagliptin (Onglyza), and sitagliptin (Januvia).  They are usually well-tolerated, but respiratory infections and nausea are possibilities. They are easily dosed at simply a pill once a day. They are fairly new, and so therefore side effect profiles may not have been worked out completely. They are also very expensive. Furthermore, they are not profoundly strong, as very high blood sugars will not respond adequately to this medication alone.

Another newer group is called the GLP-1 agonists.  These include exenatide (Byetta or Bydureon) and liraglutide (Victoza).  They are injectable, usually given with a very small needle anywhere from twice daily (Byetta) to once weekly (Bydureon).  Nausea and vomiting are the main side effects, but on a positive note, weight loss is another side effect.  It can range anywhere from a few pounds to over twenty at times.  They are fairly powerful, and so can be a good medicine to go to if simpler therapies aren‚Äôt sufficient.

Newer agents are coming out all of the time, so I suspect that this section will have to be updated soon.  But remember; pray for those afflicted by diabetes."	50.0	PT3M3S	2d	hd	False		0.0			499.0	0.0	0.0	2.0	2014-07-15T22:20:05Z	ChristianWebMD.com	16810.0	hello my name is dr. Chris comer and this is christian Web MD the topic at hand is type 2 diabetes mellitus and we're going to talk about the treatments this is the second section talking about the treatments this one focuses a bit more on the medications actually to lower blood sugar in most cases with type 2 diabetes mellitus is going to become necessary for there to be some type of medication I don't like that as some people can be treated simply with diet and exercise people ask me all the time what should I take and the answer is it depends we usually start with the medication called metformin it works very well and tends to have less side effects however there can be some nausea vomiting and even some diarrhea but most people tolerate it well and in the short term it can work reasonably well to lower blood sugars if that doesn't work or begins to fade we often have to add a second agent that second agent for instance might be an older drug called the sulfonylureas this includes Clippers I'd and glucotrol they do work but they tend to wear off after about a year and they can lower blood sugar is too much leaving the blood Sugar's low where a patient is shaking and sweating and perhaps even passing out sometimes we use a medication actos this medication does work over the long haul and can be very effective even though it's very slow to begin usually takes one to three months to work it is associated with bladder cancer however and that scare has caused a lot of patients to rethink their taking Actos I do understand that although the bladder cancer is fairly uncommon there's a couple new groups of medications out there is as well one are called a dpp-4 inhibitors this includes George enta onglyza and januvia they're usually well tolerated but respiratory infections are a possibility with these they're also not the strongest medication in the world they do seem to wear off after about a year or two another new group called the glp-1 agonist these are injectables but they use a very small needle as a matter of fact one of them you only have to inject once a week and that's by etta or by Doron and Victoza nausea and vomiting is a possibility as a matter of fact you can be such a possibility that's associated with weight loss but again that weight loss may come in a price ask your physician what's right for you these medications can be combined and are often used to avoid insulin but you have to find a regimen that's right for you remember that this video is for educational use only and if you have questions about treatment please consult your physician about this complicated topic thank you for watching christiane webmd	High Medical Info

0zot0BS1-x4	UCp29uhFxrPqHJ8tbDefgr-g	29.0	Treatment Options for Acromegaly	"Susan Samson, MD, PhD, of Baylor College of Medicine summarizes the current options for treating acromegaly

Acromegaly is a rare endocrine disease due to a benign pituitary tumor that  leads to excess production of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 hormone. 

As Dr. Samson explains in this interview, there are three options to treat this rare disease ‚Äìsurgery, radiation therapy, and/or medical therapy.  Surgery is recommended for small tumors and is the best way to cure a patient with  acromegaly. Radiation therapy can also destroy the tumor but it can take years to be effective. With regard to medical therapy, there are two options, somatostatin receptor ligands or growth hormone receptor antagonists. These medical therapies usually involve regular injections to control the acromegaly but recently, an oral somatostatin receptor ligand [Mycapssa (octreotide)] was approved."	4330.0	PT2M10S	2d	hd	False		0.0			566.0	5.0	0.0	1.0	2015-08-14T12:46:35Z	CheckRare	927772.0	well i think in most cases we first want to assess the tumor and and see if this is amenable to surgical resection smaller tumors like microadenomas that are less than a centimeter uh there's more likelihood of a cure unfortunately about two-thirds of these patients have very large tumors more than a centimeter and some of them can be very invasive and so surgical cure cannot always be attained but certainly in many cases we do try to debulk the tumor and provide some amount of growth hormone control and then after that we have to consider if that patient would be a candidate for radiotherapy or if we should try medical therapy you know radiotherapy has its own problems in the sense that it takes uh years for that to take effect so even if you see that a patient would benefit from that we still have to control the disease in the meantime and also radiotherapy can lead to some issues with [Music] hypopituitarism where now the rest of the pituitary can also be damaged and so oftentimes we will move on to a medical therapy to control this disease we really have two uh approved medications to treat acromegaly the first are somatostatin receptor ligands which bind to a receptor on the surface of the tumor and that turns down growth hormone secretion it can also cause shrinkage of the tumor so it can lead to better tumor control and it does that by leading to apoptosis of some of those cells we have a second therapy which is a growth hormone receptor antagonist that requires daily injections and that decreases the igf-1 production from the liver the major problem with these symptoms and signs however it doesn't lead to tumor control because it's not targeted at the tumor level it's targeted at the growth hormone receptor level in the tissues	High Medical Info

dietitian and a certified diabetes educator I'll be doing a mini series on carbohydrate counting and the diabetes diet now the reason so many dietitians really focus on carbohydrate counting is because it's one method of controlling your diabetes through your diet or you can eat anything that you like you just have to moderate your portion sizes and of course eating healthy foods is an important aspect of managing your blood Sugar's and staying healthy but as we discuss carb counting we'll try to avoid talking about good foods versus bad foods so what is a carbohydrate a carbohydrate is what we call a macronutrient the foods we eat are made up of three macronutrients carbohydrates proteins and fats for a healthy diet it is recommended that you get 50 percent of your calories from carbs 20 percent from protein and 30 percent from fat for diabetes the main macronutrient that affects blood sugars is carbohydrate when you eat carbohydrates they break down and they turn into sugar that sugar gets digested in your intestines and from there it goes into your bloodstream when there's sugar in your blood your pancreas releases insulin and insulin acts as a kind of key the key opens up your body cells and to allow sugar from your bloodstream into your body cells and you use that sugar for energy so that you can walk talk think play do anything now when you have type 2 diabetes your body either isn't making enough insulin so the sugar stays in your blood or your body is making enough insulin but you are what's called insulin resistance and that's when your body cells are kind of kind of have a layer of fat around them and that makes it really difficult for the insulin to actually open up your body cells so because of that the sugar just stays into your bloodstream and it's not able to enter your cells that's why we really recommend when you have type 2 diabetes that you lose weight if that's needed and that you also moderate your carbohydrates so you don't get so much sugar in your blood in the first place now foods that have carbohydrates include breads grains like rice starches including beans and pasta starchy vegetables like corn peas potatoes winter squash milk and yogurt fruit and fruit juices and of course desserts and sweets now if a food doesn't have at least 5 grams of carbohydrate we don't count it as a carb so for example if we're looking at ranch dressing you look at the label and it's 2 tablespoons for a serving and it has 2 grams of carbohydrate so since it's less than 5 we don't count this as a carb it's really more of a fat protein foods include meat chicken fish eggs cheese cottage cheese nuts peanut butter and soy and tofu and fats include butter oil mayonnaise and Miracle Whip and salad dressing the last group of carbohydrate foods is non-starchy vegetables and this basically includes any vegetable except for your starchy vegetables which are corn peas potatoes and winter squash and these are going to be free as long as you don't eat more than three cups raw or one-and-a-half cups cooked vegetables at the same time there are two ways to count carbohydrates the first way is to count actual grams of carbohydrates now this is more accurate but it's also going to be more labor-intensive and more time intensive so it's good for people who like to crunch numbers but most people prefer the second method which is carb counting and that's where we count every 15 grams of carbohydrate is counted as one carv'd choice so that what an example of that would be a slice of bread a small apple that's about the size of a tennis ball or an 8 ounce glass of milk now we'll discuss serving sizes a lot more in our next video for our purposes we'll work with using an 1800 calorie diet as you can see this diet shows that you get about 15 carb choices per day if you divide this out into three meals a day that is five-card choices per meal or 75 grams of carbohydrate per meal now I know a lot of you have probably heard that when you have diabetes you should be eating six small meals a day this is something that I really recommend that you talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian about because everybody's eating preferences are different since I work with a lot of individuals who are lucky to get two or three meals in every day and I just recommend eating three times a day and if you if you can't get all five of your carb choices in for each meal then then you save those up for a snack but you can't save them up for your next meal that would be called banking carbs and that will mess up your blood sugars throughout the entire day an important aspect of carb counting is knowing how to read a food label if you're new to reading labels I'll try to keep this really simple take for example this box of frozen pizza if we look at the serving size it tells us that it's one sixth of the pizza and the total carbohydrates is 39 grams now if we know that every 15 grams of carbohydrate is one carb choice how many carbs does one serving of pizza have it has approximately two and a half carb choices can you eat this for dinner well sure you get five carp choices so how many slices can you have without going over your 5 carp choices you could have 2 slices of pizza now here's another label this is a low-fat strawberry yogurt and I'll give you a few seconds to figure out how many car chases is in a serving now since a serving has 33 grams of carbohydrate this is going to have to card choices you can do this with any food label and fun to find out how many carbs it has this completes our overview of carbohydrate counting if you're new to diabetes I highly recommend that you go to diabetes classes of try to find out where they offer those in your area usually your doctor will know and they offer them at many hospitals our next segment is going to be entitled serving sizes and that's where we'll talk about how many carbs Isis are in various types of food so we'll see you then Thanks	Low Medical Info

This is also true for patients with type 2 diabetes and how they confront these challenges can affect their life outside of diabetes as well.	11300.0	PT5M52S	2d	hd	False		0.0			275.0	2.0	0.0	0.0	2010-11-02T14:17:00Z	HCPLive	3180046.0	I gave a presentation a of life for people with childhood always all the way up through late adulthood diabetes but also for their caregivers their parents and partners we don't assess their quality of life enough and they have it our goal doing this research is to understand that quality of life is really important that's just as important as I see Matt control and that we don't have rigorous methods to measure it and so the purpose of the project we've been doing is to develop a series of measures that assess health-related quality-of-life specific to having diabetes at different points in your life so how we assess it's different if you're in preschool or high school or old age so we've done a lot of things over the last year we have interviewed 81 people to ask them about their quality of life and then we rigorously analyzed the interviews that we had with them and from what we learned from people through those conversations created measures questionnaires surveys and then had people read those surveys and tell us what they thought of them so that we could make them a little bit better and now we have 14 different versions of this survey for all these different age ranges and whether your person with diabetes or their partner or their parent and so next starting next week we're actually starting to collect data from 3,600 people with diabetes across the country so we can test the psychometric properties of the measures and determine if they are functional and make sure that they're good to be used in clinical care and also in clinical trials research I'm a pediatric psychologist I mostly work with people with type 1 diabetes and their families but unfortunately we do have quite a few young people with type 2 diabetes and across the lifespan you know we have people with both some of the things we use to talk to people with diabetes about their quality of life are very much the same it's asking an open-ended question with sincere curiosity about someone's experience and then and listening and so that doesn't differ whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes I think some of the specific questions we ask about how your treatment impacts for example your family life or impacts the activities you do those differ by M by the type of diabetes that you have parents of kids with diabetes whether or not they want to think about their child having diabetes do not have a break from thinking about their child having diabetes it is with them from the moment they wake up through breakfast through getting ready for through school through getting to school for PE through everything they do and it doesn't end when they go to bed they think about their child having diabetes overnight and then it starts again the next day doesn't stop and so I'm less concerned about us asking questions that are going to remind their parent parents that their kid has diabetes and it's much more about creating a tool that providers and researchers and policymakers can use to say hey your quality of life matters you're more than just your a1c I want to know what it's like to live as the parent of a child with diabetes and here's a way I can assess that in a quantitative fashion so that I can do some quantitative really rigorous research around it or so that I can as a doctor say oh I see that your quality of life has improved in this way or decrease in this way so that's why we ask the questions yeah absolutely I think there's some similarities right so when we interviewed people with die or the partners of people with diabetes and the parents of younger people with diabetes some things came through very commonly across the different kinds of supporters we heard about worry a lot we heard about height love fear of hypoglycemia a lot we heard about needing to work together and support the person with diabetes and work together as a family a lot there are some unique issues though so parents of kids think a lot more about school and think a lot more about friendships whereas partners of adults might think more about finances and might think more about retirement and family planning and so there's sort of some common commonalities across ages and there's some really unique constructs that that emerge at different points in life so for the measures we created we really tried to do this developmental tailoring so that we can measure quality of life as it is relevant to kids and as it is relevant to older people and then to their partners the reason we're creating this measure is not to quantify things it will help with that and we need to be able to quantify quality of life but the reason we're creating the quality of life measure is so that providers can have that conversation with their fans with their patients so that they can say tell me about your quality of life and how can I help you I'm here to help you adjust your dose and I'm here to help you make sure that we are analyzing your blood glucose trends but I'm also here to help you live a happy healthy long productive wonderful life with diabetes want to cure absolutely and until that happens what we really want is to be able to support people with diabetes and help them live that long happy healthy productive wonderful life and so as psychologists and behavioral scientists and behavioral health specialists our job is to advocate for patients needs people with diabetes needs but families needs to make sure that their care teams remember that they're more than just an a1c and to make sure that payers fund the kinds of professionals that can help with that kind of stuff so psychologists are very poorly reimbursed for our time that we spend with patients and families and that's a huge problem because it means that diabetes centers can't hire us and then that means that people can't reach us and so that's a huge gap and so that's the future of care i think is really advocating for psychologists to be able to be integrated into care teams not just to address things like depression although that's extremely important but also to address quality of life and to address tell people adhere to the very demanding treatment regimen that kind of stuff	High Medical Info

In this video I briefly describe what body mass index is, the health risks associated with it and it's limitations. BMI is regularly used to measure whether an individual is underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese. A high BMI ( greater than 25 overweight, greater than 30 obese) is associated with a myriad of health risks BMI has two major limitations.

Body mass index, also known as BMI, is an objective way to describe someone‚Äôs height and weight.

Abstract: 
Obesity is one of the major health problems in the world today, in both developed and third world countries. Being overweight or obese increases the risk of developing insulin resistance and diabetes; about 85-90% of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese.
Nutritional guidelines for diabetes rely on moderating carbohydrate intake and promoting weight loss. Recent meta- analysis suggest that weight loss, and not any particular diet, is the most important intervention for improving glucose levels (1,2). A recent Cochrane review of dietary advice for diabetes control concluded, ""There are no high quality data on the efficacy of the dietary treatment of type 2 diabetes""(3).
There is, however, evidence in short term studies, that dietary composition can affect glucose control independent of weight loss. Thus studies of isocaloric Paleolithic-type diets demonstrate improvement of glucose levels and insulin sensitivity. Which component(s) of the ""paleo-diet"" is responsible for these improvements are not known. The diet is high in fiber and very large increases in fiber in the diet can lower glucose levels. Another possibility is that the quantity or quality of foods can alter neuro-hormonal control of appetite and satiety. In our presentation, we will review evidence available from clinical trials comparing dietary treatments for diabetes.

type low salt diet they lost weight they increase the amount of exercise so if you had to say to yourself you know what what do we tell people to do I mean this is what we tell people to do so then if you say to yourself so how well did that work okay in the premier diet yeah their BMI z' went down a little bit and their glucose improved a little bit and their insulin levels went down a little tiny bit and their insulin sensitivity index improved compared to the control diet we're in the control diet actually their insulin levels went up so you know yeah if you say to yourself what am I trying to do so lower BMI yell lower insulin yeah lower glucose yeah does this treatment work yeah but does are the results very impressive no not even a little bit and so then you wonder why it is that people don't seem to get very much out of diet and we end up giving them pills all the time it's cuz really diet isn't working all that great so then you say to yourself if you really want to give somebody a diet for their diabetes you know what other options are there and that's where we came to these studies with the Paleo diet where you know like you can show them actually why don't I just show the results so this was our study now I work in a research center so what that means is that we make all the food that we give to people so they're not being told what to do we have them come in we figure out how many calories we need we feed them exactly the diet we want them to eat we make them bring back all the food that they didn't eat we weigh them every day you know we make sure that if they're losing weight we feed them more calories so in as much as you can control the things that you can control for diet research we try to do that so in our healthy volunteers and these were healthy volunteers who were a little bit overweight and in order to qualify for this study they had to fail the exercise test so we put him on a treadmill and if they were at or below the average for their age and sex than they were qualified for the study and in our in these healthy people otherwise healthy after two weeks okay with no weight loss because remember we didn't let them lose weight yeah what you can see is you guys see the No okay so I'll just explain so in the graph on the left okay what you can see is that the more the subjects followed the diet which is the higher their urine potassium excretion was okay the greater the change in the amount of insulin so the amount of insulin went down the more they followed the diet and when you said to yourself who are the people who got the most better like everybody got a little better but the people who are insulin resistant were the ones who got the most better and so that's actually what prompted us to do studies in people who had type 2 diabetes it's because the ones who were the most insulin resistant seemed to be the people who are doing the best and this is dr. Linda Berg's data and in this study they looked at people who had heart disease so ischemic heart disease which means their blood vessels are all clogged up with atherosclerosis and usually these people have high blood pressure and oftentimes they're overweight and when he put these people on the Paleo diet what he found and this is the graphed on the left is that when they give people these glucose tests where you drink this glass of glucose and then you check to see what their blood sugar levels are you could see that on the left the ones who are on the Paleo diet their blood sugar levels didn't go up as high as the ones on the right and the ones on the right are are on a Mediterranean type diet and when you looked at the total change in the amount of blood sugar over time when you have them drink this glass of sugar then you could see that the paleolithic group had much lower levels of glucose over time than the ones on the Mediterranean diet and at the same time and dr. linda berg was looking at waist to hip circumference so he's looking to see whether or not their waistline improved and yes they did and then he did another study where he took people with type 2 diabetes and he switched them from one diet to another and having tried to do a study like this I am totally impressed that he got this many people to do this study for this period of time this is amazingly difficult research to do and what you can see is that the people on the Paleolithic diet which are the round clear OHS okay on the Paleo diet their hemoglobin a1cs were lower their HDL where hires HDL is the good cholesterol was higher their triglycerides were lower their diastolic blood pressures went down their weights went down so compared so when they switch these people from one diet to another they were able to find that you know that these same people did better on the Paleo diet than they did on this Mediterranean diet and this is pretty amazing results because these people were not in a metabolic Ward like the studies that I do these people actually were just told what to do here here's some instructions to follow so the fact that they were able to show this at all with people who are out in the community who are just eating their their food that they were making themselves over such a long period of time really thought was very impressive so we then went back and again we do studies where we make all the food for people and then we follow them every day ok so this is from our study in our diabetic patients and what you could see is that in the purple is the Paleo diet and in the brown is the American Diabetes Association diet and our American Diabetes Association diet was really a Mediterranean diet and so these measures of glucose control like fructosamine and fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin a1c the little stars mean that that was significant and we did something called u glycemic hyper insulin clamps which is considered to be the gold standard by endocrinology doctors for looking at what's happening to the body's insulin and sugar requirements and so the lower the M values the worse you are so none of our patients were very good so they all got better both both groups got better the ad a diet got better and the Paleo diet got better but when we said to ourselves so who how did these people improve and this is the graph on the right hand side so what you see on the bottom graphed is that the people with the low M values which is the pretreatment M though the ones with the low M values were actually the ones who had their M values go up the most and as a clinic and as a clinician and as a doctor who you know my patients never do what I tell them to do so if I have to spend energy trying to get people to do something I want to ask myself what's the group that I think is going to get the most results for you know for all the energy that I'm putting in who should I concentrate on and I think it's totally fascinating that you know the people who are the worst are the ones that got the most better and those are the people that you really want to help okay not the ones who are sort of okay anyway but the ones who are in terrible shape those are the people that you would really like to be able to help and this is apparently what the Paleo diet does in these people is those are the people that improve the most and I fought and as a kidney doctor I find that incredibly helpful because you know diabetes is the number one cause of kidney disease in the United States so this is an amazing result so so far I've shown that you know the paleo diets lower glucose and lower insulin and really appear to do it better than the so-called regular diets that we use the American Diabetes Association diets and now I am going to go way out on limb and I'm going to talk about some of the reasons why these might possibly work so that's the Panda out there on the limb and so they're you know I've heard a lot of people say oh it's the insulin levels it's the leptin levels it's the energy expenditure it's the carbohydrates it's where you get the carbohydrates from you know I don't know the answer to that but I would be amazed if it was just one thing I mean there's not very many things in the body where there's only one pathway that takes care of stuff most of the stuff that it's in the body is redundant there are many pathways and so I'd be totally amazed if it was just one thing it's more a question of perhaps like what's more important than you know another and you know that I don't think we have an answer tube so what I'm presenting here is really just some of the things some of the possibilities that influence why one person might be more insulin sensitive or insulin resistant than another and there's a long list here and so I'll talk about some of them so genetics okay some people are just predisposed to developing diabetes we know that because diabetes runs in families and at least some of it may have to do with where do you put the fat so do you put the fat around the middle are you apple pie and your legs so are you pear-shaped is it a question of what's happening to the to the signals inside the cell after they get past the insulin receptors that are in the cells a lot of people talk about post receptor insulin signaling changes and how that affects how the body how the cell is able to use the sugar that gets in whether or not your blood pressure goes up when you eat a lot of salt yeah some people doesn't matter how much salt you eat your blood pressure is not going to change at all and other people if you increase the amount of salt that you eat your blood pressure will go way up people who have whose blood pressures go up when you eat a lot of salt have a tendency to fall into that metabolic syndrome category and this study showed that in the graphs on the left as the amount of salt went up okay in the little yellow things are insulin secretion so the yellow people are the insulin sensitive people the people whose blood whose blood pressures went up when they eat a lot of salt insulins also went up when they ate a lot of salt so just eating a lot of salt if you're one of those people whose blood pressures go up with salt you're going to secrete more insulin and if secreting insulin is bad for you because it makes your beta cells wear out faster it's really low insulin that we're shooting for it then you would this would be the kind of person that you would want to say maybe it's the amount of salt that they're eating and in our study when we broke down whose blood pressures went up with salt and whose didn't you could see that there was a significantly lower significant more significant decrease in blood sugar levels and fructosamine levels in the salt sensitive people on the Paleo diet compared to the salt resistant people on the Paleo diet so at least in our subjects those people who had the most blood pressure went up the most were the ones that got the most better when we put them on this low salt Paleo diet tissue hypoxia so tissue oxygen levels are one of those new things that people are talking about a lot today and turns out that anesthesiologists do this all the time they stick needles into people while you're asleep and then they measure things like oxygen levels and so fat people tend to have lower tissue oxygen levels compared to people who are not obese and you can show that just having low tissue oxygen levels will both decrease your insulin sensitivity and lower how much glucose your cells take up even in non obese people and oxygen is really important because oxygen is the final pathway for the main elect for the main energy system inside the cell which is called the mitochondrial electron transport chain and so normally what happens is the oxygen finally accepts the electron and then the system gets regenerated but if you don't have enough oxygen in your tissues then what happens is you have these backup pathways and one backup pathway is the one that goes from pyruvate to lactate so now you're making lactic acid so you have extra acid in your system and then the second one is one that uses the coenzyme q and uses the so called NADPH oxidase or duck taste pathway and that causes these reactive oxygen species to accumulate so what you see is when your tissues don't get enough oxygen you're you're increasing both the amount of acids in the body as well as the amount of the reactive oxygen species and both of those are bad and and we know that in people who have like people with kidney failure who have metabolic acidosis we can wrap for example we can show that all that acid directly affects how the insulin receptors and the igf-1 receptors work so actually just having too much acid in your system makes your insulin receptors not work well and similarly we can show that oxidative stress effects of those cellular pathways that that happen after the insulin receptor is turned on affects these intracellular pathways and these do a lot of things depending on where the tissues are and they're different depending on the different tissues so they can affect glucose uptake in the muscles and they can affect the amount of how much the blood vessel dilates which is a really big deal in the heart and in the blood vessels in the body okay and now let's talk about a little bit about free fatty acids I've heard a couple people talk about this too so free fatty acids come from breaking down fat tissue and in the liver they increase the amount of glucose that's formed and in the muscles they prevent the insulin from being taken up and so you make more glucose you use less glucose and the body's glucose levels go up and turns out that people who are overweight or obese have higher free fatty acid levels which then as we said leads to hyperglycemia and just having high blood sugar levels in and of itself can cause toxicity so for example it can cause the lenses in the eyes to become dense so you can't see very well it can actually alter how well thus the cells respond to insulin signaling and it can cause more inflammation and higher levels of these so called advanced glycosylation and products which is where the glucose is attached to various other molecules in the body and they accumulate then they don't break down the way they should and then secondarily a lot of these people who are obese have this second problem which is that the beta cells of the pancreas stop making enough insulin so now not only is your blood sugar level high but your pancreas isn't making enough insulin so there was this totally fascinating article in one of the kidney journals this past month and I really thought I have no idea if this is true or not but this is true really fascinating so Savelle imir is something that we give to bind phosphate in the gut people with kidney failure have high phosphate sand that's bad for you and so we give this Civello more stuff but this group these investigators gave it to people that they weren't trying to control their phosphate they decided to look to see whether or not it would lower oxidant oxidative stress levels and what they found was that not only one it lowered cholesterol and triglyceride levels nobody has ever shown this before like giving this medication which we use oh it's not absorbed in the body it stays in the gut it's an ion exchange resin and yet it lowered cholesterol and triglyceride levels in these diabetic patients with mild moderate kidney disease it also decreased the amount of these advanced glycation end-products it lowered oxidant levels it increased antioxidant levels so whatever it's doing it's not doing it inside the body it's doing it in the gut and it made me wonder whether or not all the fiber that you eat in the Paleolithic diet might have some similar effect like somebody was talking about fructose and how fructose is bad for you so we did a study in some of our patients because our paleo diets were much higher in fructose than our a.da diets and so we did a balanced study to see what was happening inside the liver with the fructose that we were giving and it turned out that there was no difference in what the liver was doing with the fructose between the Palio group and the ad a group and so the diabetes guys that I worked with began to think it was maybe because of the fiber in the gut something but maybe the fructose wasn't actually getting into the body even though the diets themselves actually had more fructose in them and so maybe this Savelle immerse tough is doing the same thing at fibrous I don't know as total this is a really amazing study I have to say I expect to see more from these investigators about this so we decided to look at inflammation in our subjects and for those of you who don't know very much about adiponectin and I'm going to tell you I'm one of them okay so one thing that happens when you have a lot of inflammation is that something called il-6 which is a cytokine causes the liver to make something that's called CRP which is C reactive protein and both of those are indicative of inflammation when you have high adiponectin levels okay then supposedly that's going to cause the inflammation to decrease and adiponectin is responsive to blood sugars so as your blood sugars go down you're out of Renekton levels are supposed to go up and that's supposed to lower the amount of inflammation in the body so that's what we expected to find instead what we found was that both adiponectin and meat in the supposedly active form high molecular weight out of po nekton both of those went down significantly at the same time il-6 levels went up in both groups and CRP went up in the ad a group and went down in the Palio group but okay we had much lower blood sugars okay twenty thirty milligrams per deciliter lower on average than when they started so we would have expected out of Renekton levels to go up instead they went way down and then I got this slide from our next presenter actually where he was showing what our adiponectin levels in islanders who live off of Papua New Guinea compared to people in Sweden and you can see that that's the Kotova okay had much lower at Epona kyun levels than Swedes of the same age did so maybe it's not that the adiponectin levels went down that's important maybe it's that the adiponectin levels are low that's important and that that means that everybody else is out of connecting resistant just like doctor Rosedale was saying it yes we're all insulin resistant and Isis personally suspect well leptin resistant too but it makes you ask you know what biomarkers should we measure should we measure leptin should we measure the relationship of leptin to the leptin receptor should we measure is high-molecular-weight out of connecting the one to measure or not should we be you know I don't know the answer to this but it makes me wonder if we're measuring the right things and then finally how am i doing for time there okay so finally I read this other article about sleep and mice and if those of you who went to see Gary Taubes lecture so he was talking about is the fact that low-carb that you lose weight with calorie restriction is it really the calorie restriction is it just that you have less energy in or more energy out or is it because you're eating a low-carb diet and your insulin levels are low so what they did here was they gave this the mice this new molecule that they've discovered and it's called SR 901 one and what it does is it makes the mouse's cells use more oxygen so in dr. Talib's equation okay that was the increased energy expenditure without the increased energy in so the mice ate the same diet all the time and then they got this SR 901 one stuff and when they did that the mice lost weight they lost fat you can see over there and it says vo2 that's the one that shows that they're actually using more oxygen so they're just expending more energy and their glucose levels went down and their insulin levels went down and their leptin levels went down and there is six levels went down so less inflammation less leptin resistance less insulin resistance whatever and all because you gave the mice these things which affected the supposedly the the activation system of the clock in our brain that controls like sleepest that wouldn't go to sleep and when we wake up and so then I started looking at other studies where you know where you look at what happens to leptin levels so it turns out wept in is one of those things that it's highest in the middle of the night when you're asleep and it's lowest in the middle of the afternoon and leptin for those of you who don't know so leptin is one of those things that blocks the hunger chemicals in your brain and it turns on the satiety chemicals in your brain so that you're not as hungry and you don't and you eat less so if you have really high leptin levels then you're not going to want to eat as much and if you have low leptin levels and you're going to be hungrier so if you don't get enough sleep then your leptin levels go down and you get hungry and at the same time it turns out that you're also it's become more insulin resistance so lack of sleep is bad for you but dr. linda bergstrom actually started looking at leptin levels and satiety because if you're saying to yourself with the Paleo diet really it's just that I'm not as hungry and so I don't eat as many calories then you should you would perhaps expect that what should happen is that leptin levels should go up high leptin levels not as hungry instead what they found is that the the people who are on the Paleo diet and that's in the open circles so they actually felt fuller on a lower carbohydrate intake but their leptin levels went down so again it makes me ask like our out of connecting levels went down their leptin levels went down maybe maybe the whole thing about having lower levels is correct and that it does when you're resistant to these neuro to these hormones then having lower levels it's better but if you're normal having higher levels is better I don't actually know the answer to this but if leptin is one of those molecules that then promote satiety and lower carb intakes and helps improve blood sugar and you know and perhaps is related to how we're sleeping then you know perhaps just sleeping more might be something that might actually help you so to review I think tried to show that the Paleo diet does improve insulin sensitivity and my personal belief is that this is especially true in people who are more insulin resistant and perhaps salt sensitive that if you had to concentrate on somebody to like like you should do this diet that would be the group I would choose and so I think you can show that the Paleo diet improves glucose control compared to other diets that we've used for diabetes or there a variety of reasons why this might be true genetics related to obesity related to diabetes related to satiety related to sleep I don't really know the answer to that anyway thank you very much for your attention these are my collaborator hello thank you for the talk that was very nice I wanted to I wanted to ask a little bit more about your Paleo diet interventions because you mentioned that it was higher in fructose and if I recall it correct me if I'm wrong but a lot of the fructose was coming from juiced fruits and vegetables is that correct and we served 3 servings of either like juice or vegetables yeah one per meal so I mean it seems to me that they must have been absorbing the fructose you know I'm not going to say no to that I'm gonna say that we couldn't show that there was any difference in hepatic uptake or utilization of fructose between the two groups and yet even though the group that was the Palio group was eating more fruit toast they had lower fructose levels lower blood blood blood fructose levels and fructosamine levels yeah so I don't know I can only infer because it's been 35 years since eaten on corner published set of papers and there have been only 5 control studies that have actually tested very hrithik diet and control conditions so I really thank you for that secondly I want to put emphasis on on certain suggestions given in this study people are usually advice are advised to follow up a little thick diet they are not given any advice on the nutrient composition there is all this talk about you know low carb Ike are the Paleolithic diet research doesn't need to get metal love in this debate the most important thing now correct me if I'm wrong I might be wrong here the most important thing here in Paleolithic diet research is changing the sources of macro nutrient composition instead of giving advice on high-protein low-carb low-fat when when this diet regime started 35 years ago based on that research if you if you have read about this research there was this paper published plant and animal subsets of subsistence ratios in that paper and was a co-author of that paper Lauren Gordon was the primary author and he they became up with a range of numbers 90 to 35 percent protein 20 to 40 percent carbohydrates and 28 to 58 percent fat there is no suggestions in from this research on how much car how much protein or fat we should consume the most important thing is changing sources of these macronutrient and macronutrients so instead of driving your energy from grains and dairy you derive your energy from fruits veggies and lean meat seafood some nuts and root with rivets that's all that I wanted to say I wanted to say that now because we have already had two talks on carbohydrates and starch and we now we have under the two talks lined up on the actual studies that have been done on Paleolithic diet so I thought of bringing up this point okay thank you I mean I actually have to say that you know I think dr. Eaton clearly showed that there's no one Palio diet it really depended where on the planet you were from so I'm sure that some people are eating blower carbs than others some people were not eating every day and so they were intermittently ketotic you know I mean I think you know there probably isn't one there's probably a variety and I actually agree with the person who got up here and said that it's more question of where does it come from thank you you	Low Medical Info

Marlene Merritt and I'm here to explain blood sugar because I realized that nobody really understands blood sugar really well which is why I've kind of made this video called blood sugar for dummies so in describing blood sugar the reason I'm doing this because I want to be able to have people understand what happens when they eat things and why they can't seem to lose weight and why we this whole country has an epidemic of being tired and feeling terrible basically so let me kind of explain what happens and we'll start out with if it's a normal person if a normal person eats like say a Belote meal the oatmeal goes into your stomach it goes into your small intestine and it breaks down into glucose which is the form of fuel that your body uses and the glucose goes through the walls of the small intestine and into the blood and now it's called blood glucose which is what they measure on a blood test literally the number of glucose molecules goes up and that's what they're measuring so glucose by itself actually can't be dealt with in the body without insulin so insulin gets released by the pancreas the insulin takes the glucose and puts it into the cells and it does that until the glucose is at a low level and then you don't need the insulin anymore and then in theory you burn fat until the next time you eat and then the blood sugar goes up again and then the insulin deals with it brings the level back down just like that now type one diabetes is when somebody has glucose in their system but they don't have any insulin and the body can't recognize it without insulin and so the glucose just kind of runs around the system until the kidneys finally figure out there's too much sugar there and it flushes it out and that's actually how they found diabetes back in the late 1800s as a woman peed on the ground and the ants came to her urine because there was so much sugar in it but that's type 1 diabetes so that's how a normal person's blood sugar works as the insulin takes the glucose and puts it off to the cells now back in the mid-1980s there was a change in the public health policy where they associated fat saturated fat causing heart problems and so then began what is really a low-fat health policy and so that low-fat health policy had people eating like a bowl of you know if you're being healthy with a whole grain cereal with skim milk and you'd have like a half a banana and a small glass of orange juice and then you'd go to lunch and you'd have a sandwich if you're really healthy it was whole-grain and low-fat turkey and baked potato chips and maybe a diet soda and then in the afternoon maybe you'd have a whole-grain granola bar and then a dinner you'd have like pasta with vegetables or you'd have like a you know baked chicken with rice but you wouldn't put any butter on the rice like that and so all day your blood sugar would go up and down all day in your system dealt with that for a while but at some point it started to break down because it was an enormous amount of carbohydrates for what your system is technically able to handle so how it started to break down is your body started to predict you were going to have a carbohydrate so when your blood sugar started to rise your body would give you insulin but it would give you too much so now what would happen is the insulin would do its job it would take the glucose out of the system and put it into the cells and the problem here is that you still had insulin left and insulin left in the bloodstream does a few things one is it causes sugar cravings there's insulin in your bloodstream is what causes you to want more carbohydrates more sugar and so people will then you know because insulin wants to be entertained with sugar so it people then would go and you know they'd have sugar cravings and they have carb cravings all day so if you eat more carbohydrates again the insulin will go up so it goes back and forth like this all day insulin your blood stream also tends to cause what's called reactive hypoglycemia the reactive hypoglycemia is because your system reacts by giving you too much insulin and hypoglycemia is where the insulin drives down the blood sugar too low there has to be a base level of glucose in your blood stream because 30 to 40 percent of your blood brain function comes from this so you need to be able to have good glucose in your system to keep your brain functioning so when the insulin in your bloodstream and it drives the glucose down too low now you can't function and people walk around saying I can't think and I'm too tired and they're irritable and they can't concentrate and they have terrible memory that's all because your brain is basically not being fed so that's reactive hypoglycemia like too low blood sugar but you could also call that too much insulin then the other the last thing is for most people most predominant for them is that the presence of insulin your bloodstream completely prevents you from burning fat so now you have kind of an interesting thing happening you have no energy coming from your bloodstream because you have no blood sugar there and you can't access fat which is the storage unit for fuel for your body so when people walk around and they're tired all the time and they don't know why and then they have sugar cravings so they'll eat some I don't know whatever schoo and a bagel up crackers whatever this isn't it pulls your blood sugar back up and the insulin goes back up again but you feel better because your blood Sugar's back up now there's a couple of side things that happens when you have hypoglycemia and your blood sugar goes down there are a couple of glands called your adrenals they sit on top of your kidneys and one of they do a bunch of different things but one of the things that they do is they jump in every time your blood sugar gets low to bring it back up so if people have you know a history of kind of eating a lot of carbs where the blood sugar goes up and down your adrenals are constantly jumping in and trying to get your blood sugar to go back up and at some point they get tired and they stop working and that also contributes to people being tired now one of the big symptoms of people who have blood sugar issues and some adrenal fatigue is they tend to wake up in the middle of the night your blood sugar has gotten too low basically and your body is it's kind of in a panic because it doesn't have enough blood sugar to keep your brain functioning so it wakes you up basically to keep you from falling into a coma so that's what happens on on the side so when people talk about adrenal fatigue yes adrenal fatigue is rampant in this society and one of the main reasons for it is because people don't manage their blood sugar properly so going back to where we were here from hypoglycemia so now if somebody has insulin constantly in their bloodstream going up and down at some point what happens is what's called insulin resistance and that's because those cells that took the glucose they get kind of tired of being bathed in insulin all the time and so they start becoming resistant and they don't want to pick up the glucose when the insulin molecules are bringing it by and so what happens is a couple of things one is the glucose starts to back up in the bloodstream now the body manages this for quite some time and it does this by turning that glucose into fat and in doing that it's not a natural pathway has to force that to happen and the middle step between that is triglycerides and so when somebody comes in and they have high triglycerides on a blood test I know it's almost always because they're eating too many carbohydrates so you've got fat being made over here from the glucose is in your bloodstream you have an inability to burn fat because you have insulin constantly present in your blood and then the other thing is is insulin resistance causes something called metabolic syndrome and metabolic syndrome is kind of a bunch of different symptoms but what we see most often is that it causes hormonal problems and the hormonal problems it causes are in women it causes high estrogen and high testosterone and so when you see like those older women they've got like thinning hair up here that's male pattern baldness from high testosterone now for men it causes high estrogen and low testosterone and what that looks like in men is they kind of they get man boobs in a beer belly that's what high estrogen causes and that's metabolic syndrome as a separate thing just causing hormonal problems but on the side there you also have weight gain that comes from estrogen this is the reason that they inject estrogen into cattle is because it causes weight gain in cattle so what you've got is high estrogen it has his own little vicious circle happening over to the side high estrogen causes weight gain which causes fat cells fat cells manufacture their own estrogen which then causes weight gain and so you've got that going on there so basically you've got weight gain happening because you have estrogen your bloodstream preventing you any access to fat you have glucose backing up in the bloodstream and the body converting it into fat and then you have estrogen levels causing you to retain that and create some more so this would be why nobody's losing weight in this country so as what we've done now so we've gone from hypoglycemia we've moved into insulin resistance because it's all along a line here and so most of the patients that we see have some combination of hypoglycemia and insulin resistance some people are flat out and insulin resistance but as time marches on what happens then is people start becoming diabetic and the way that happens is because at some point the body cannot convert enough glucose over into fat through the triglyceride cycle I was just telling you about and the glucose starts to back up in the bloodstream and then people come in they're like you know I can't get my blood sugar under control it's too high it's like okay well so what the body does is it basically kicks your pancreas in an effort to try to have it put out more insulin to manage all the glucose that's in the bloodstream and at some point the pancreas gets tired and then you have diabetes and it was all along a line like this the whole thing is simply a progression and it is actually reversible but it is a progression eighty-one percent of people at the age of 55 are diabetic or pre-diabetic eighty-one percent so it's four out of five adults at the age of 55 now this doesn't come out of the blue it comes because they haven't managed their blood sugar for decades basically it's kind of like this when I describe it to people it's like you're given a certain amount of points for carbohydrates in your lifetime and most people have used those all up before the age of say 35 and so from this point forward you actually if you want to be healthy you don't get to go back to how you were eating there like we've used up all of our points now we've got to figure out what to do from this point forward to keep from being sick or ending up as diabetes	High Medical Info

diabetes should it get worse all the time as it usually does or is that as simple is that because we're treating it totally wrong or not even treating it at all uh that's what i'm going to talk about with my guest today [Music] i'm andrea sanford from dietdoctor.com and i'm here with dr jason fang a methodologist from canada welcome oh thanks very much so i just uh watched a presentation by you i thought it was really fantastic it was about how we treat diabetics today in the medical system and you're a nephrologist you meet you meet uh diabetics uh when they're when they've had their disease for a long time and they're really sick right yeah so i treat people on dialysis that's a lot of what i do and it's very disheartening because what happens is that when they develop their disease they're so sick but the diabetes itself is actually quite reversible and that's one of the things that i realized a short while ago and that's what needs to be understood is that this is not a disease that needs to progress but we often tell people so that it's a chronic progressive disease and that's not simply me talking but if you go to the diabetes associations whether it's the american diabetes association or the diabetes australia they all put out there that this is a chronic disease and they tell people essentially that you have diabetes you'll have it for the rest of your life you might as well get used to it but the problem is that that's simply not true and it's actually pretty easy to to prove it because if somebody came up to me and said i've had diabetes i was told i had diabetes i watched my diet i lost 50 pounds i cut my carbs i cut my sugar and now they took me off of my medication i'm fine now that's obviously true nobody would say oh you're lying right so that patient who has lost the weight who has changed their diet has increased their exercise for instance their diabetes actually got better and the thing is that if that patient got better what happens to this idea that this is a chronic progressive disease well obviously it's not true because any time that happens every time it happens it means that the disease is actually reversible but you have to know how to reverse it if you don't know how to reverse it then you're just going to get worse and the thing is that the drugs don't actually do anything for the disease and this is also not controversial because the thing is that type 2 diabetes is a disease of too much insulin resistance and that's not controversial everybody acknowledges that right so if you have very high insulin resistance it's going to cause high blood sugar right but that's the symptom of the disease the disease is actually too much insulin resistance so the treatments that we give are all targeted at blood sugar right that doesn't make any sense because it's almost like to give an analogy if you have an infection if you have a leg infection well you need to treat that infection so what was causing it was bacteria you give antibiotics but that infection can give you a fever but that fever is not the disease if you start treating that fever as if it is the disease then that leg wound is going to fester because you're treating the symptoms of the disease and ignoring the disease but that's what we've done with type 2 diabetes we're treating the blood sugar but it's not a it's not a disease of the blood sugar it's a disease of too much insulin resistance so what happens is that because we're not treating the disease the disease tends to progress so if you look at what happens over a period of 10 years 15 years what happens is that you start off with one medication then you take two medications and three then you take insulin then more incident more insulin and after 10 years you started with one medication now you're on 100 units of insulin a day well you're taking more medication to do the same job to keep that blood sugar the same that means your diabetes is worse even if your blood sugar is better your diabetes is worse than it's ever been because you've never actually done anything about treating the insulin resistance so that patient who went and lost weight and exercised and cut out the carbs and cut out the sugars they actually reversed their insulin resistance and therefore their sugars came down which is far different than making your blood sugars go down by force by medication and ignoring the actual disease so that's the fundamental mistake that we've made over this last 20 30 40 years right we've treated the disease of type 2 diabetes which is too much insulin as if it was type 1 diabetes which is too little insulin so you got to understand that type 1 diabetes has too little insulin so that makes sense you should give them insulin type 2 diabetes is too much insulin you need to reduce their insulin but instead we're giving more insulin to a disease state that has too much insulin well of course that's crazy and you had an analogy there as well uh in in your talk you're saying it's like that would be like treating an alcoholic where the exactly so if you have a disease such as alcoholism where it is characterized by too much alcohol the very last thing you want to do is give more alcohol and that seems very obvious right but if you look in the short term as you take away the alcohol they might get the shakes they might get delirium tremendous if you give them alcohol they will feel better in the short term right but that doesn't mean you're going to make the alcoholism better right that's the real problem it's the alcoholism you can't treat the short-term thing at the expense of the long-term what we've done is treat the short-term we said wow your blood sugar is high let me get it down right but it's like well what's happening to the disease who cares what's happening to the blood sugar what's happening to the disease it continues to get worse so it's just like that alcohol too much alcohol the disease is too much alcohol the cure cannot be to give more alcohol right so to be clear giving insulin to right type 2 diabetics it's like giving alcohol to an alcoholic exactly exactly so this is too much it's insane in fact it's not simply that it's not treating it it's going to actually make it worse just like giving that alcohol you have a disease which is characterized by too much insulin you're giving more insulin you're not making it better you're actually making it worse so the patient will gain weight and they will their insulin resistance will get worse exactly yeah and the funny part is that the patients all know this because this is what happens and i talk to a lot of patients and they say they go to their doctor they start insulin then they gain 15 pounds 20 pounds right which is we we all know that happened that's not a secret because insulin is what really drives weight gain so what happens is that they take the insulin they gain weight and they go back to the doctor and say doc what's this you tell me i need to lose weight to get better then you go and give me a medication that makes me gain 20 pounds this is not good and the doctor always says something like well what are you gonna do you need to take the insulin go exercise right but the problem is that it was not the lack of exercise that made them gain weight it was the insulin that made them gain weight so you need to treat that you need to reduce it so what do you do what do you do if you're a type 2 diabetic well the thing is that it's a dietary disease right and if you're a type 2 diabetic it's a dietary disease it's a disease of essentially too much sugar so if you understand it like that then the answer is to get that sugar out get it down so the first thing you need to do is cut out all the sugar cut out a lot of these refined carbohydrates which are just sugar so the breads in the pasta right so they're all chains of sugar that's all carbohydrates are chains of sugar as you eat them they get broken down into sugar so if you have too much sugar if diabetes is essentially too much sugar you got to stop taking sugar otherwise you're going to make it worse so that's probably the first thing you can do more exercise try and burn it off and the other thing that you can do is try to do something more extreme such as fasting for instance you can actually more extreme than a strict low carb diet i love it okay fasting tell me more about it so fasting is actually the most efficient and the most effective way to lower insulin there's really no drug that does it there are actually two but they're not very effective to lower insulin but if you understand that the disease is too much sugar too much insulin then you gotta say well if it's too much sugar too much let's get rid of the sugar let's get the insulin down how am i going to do that right so the thing about the sugar you can go on a very low carb diet a ketogenic diet and that will get your sugars down but it doesn't necessarily get your insulin down because the proteins and the fats still raise insulin not to the same degree that carbohydrates do but they still raise insulin so you can get that sugar down but you won't get that insulin down so you can actually put people on various periods of fasting because you're not taking anything uh it's it's not simply low carb it's low protein and low fat right it's nothing nothing at all so think about what's going to happen here the body is not going to have anything coming in so what is going to happen is it's going to start burning that sugar and that's perfect that's exactly what we want it to do it starts burning sugar burning sugar after it burns the sugars your sugars come down you don't have to take medications you don't have to take insulin after that it starts burning fat that's perfect that's exactly what we want to do and there's always two questions that come up when you talk about fasting one can i do it and the thing is you have to understand is that literally billions of people around the world fast on a regular basis through their entire lives right so the muslims the hindus the buddhists the catholics almost every major religion in the world prescribes fasting not because it's super harmful because it's very beneficial and what they what happens during the fast is that your insulin levels go down perfect that's exactly what we want but so what we're doing is we're burning off all that sugar and getting it out of the system right as opposed to just getting it out of the blood we're actually getting it out of the entire body so the fasting does both things it lowers the insulin and it lowers the sugars the other thing that always comes up with fasting is is it harmful and this is what always comes up am i going to go into starvation mode and what's interesting when you look at fasting is that studies of fasting show the exact opposite you don't have less energy you have more energy so there are certain things that get activated when you're fasting so growth hormone goes up for instance to preserve lean muscle then you'd start burning just fat adrenaline goes up to give you more energy and you're fueling all that energy with fat because you can measure free fatty acids in the blood and they go up so what's happening is that you're burning fat you're preserving your muscle and you've got plenty of energy perfect that is like the perfect treatment [Music] [Applause]	Low Medical Info

sugar over time it does this by taking a look at how much sugar is attached to your red blood cells the more sugar that is attached the higher your hba1c in this video we'll take a look at how this test works and ways to keep your results in the healthy range hba1c goes by different names so you might hear it referred to as simply the a1c test the hemoglobin a1c test or the glycated hemoglobin test and while this last name is the most complex it does the best job of explaining what the test measures which is the amount of sugar or glucose that is sticking to a specific protein in your red blood cells called hemoglobin the process of glucose binding to hemoglobin is called glycation hence the name the glycated hemoglobin test your red blood cells are great targets for this test because of their unique structure and how they use glucose to survive red blood cells are plentiful in your bloodstream and their primary job is to carry oxygen around your body and they take their job very seriously so we see that as red blood cells mature they fill up with more and more hemoglobin which is the protein that actually carries the oxygen but this accumulation of hemoglobin makes things very cramped inside the cells so to make room mature red blood cells sacrifice their mitochondria mitochondria are the powerhouses that the majority of your cells rely on to make energy without these powerhouses your red blood cells must get their energy through a much less efficient process that involves the fermentation of glucose and while this process works it wears the cells out quickly so the average lifespan of a red blood cell is relatively short and typically only a few months in length during that short life your red blood cells provide a record of how much glucose they encounter which acts as a good indicator of how well you've been controlling your blood sugar over time and this ability to reveal a picture of your average blood sugar over a few months is what makes the hba1c test useful as a screening test for pre-diabetes and diabetes now having red blood cells that are essentially sugar-coated may sound a bit alarming but it's normal to have some glycation present so your hba1c would never be 0 according to the National Institute for Health a person without diabetes would have an a1c level below 5.7 percent whereas a person with diabetes would have an a1c of 6.5 or above and in between these two figures a person would be classified as having pre-diabetes so you can see that keeping your hba1c low is a desirable goal unfortunately there are a number of actions that you can take to naturally lower your results the best approach is to reduce the amount of quick digesting carbohydrates that you're eating when you eat carbohydrates your digestive tract breaks them down into glucose which is then transported into your blood where the simple sugar comes in contact with your red blood cells so you want to eat in a way that minimizes the rush of sugar into your blood and that is done by reducing carbs that break down quickly like sugar and refined carbs which I refer to as the three C's cookies cakes and candies some carbohydrates like leafy greens non starchy vegetables nuts and seeds contain fiber and nutrients that slow their breakdown and absorption so you don't need to eliminate all carbs from your diet just make different choices exercise is also beneficial because it helps your body use the sugar that is available by improving insulin sensitivity when your cells are more insulin sensitive they have an easier time pulling sugar out of your blood so there is less circulating and the exercise does not have to be exhausting to be helpful even short brisk walks after dinner can move you into a positive direction these lifestyle changes when done consist can result in weight loss which is another way you can bring down your hba1c naturally in fact the effects of weight loss can be dramatic this study followed 522 middle-aged overweight men and women for more than three years during the study the subjects were split into an intervention group that was given help losing weight and a control group due to the lifestyle changes that resulted in weight loss the risk of diabetes was reduced by 58 percent in the intervention group so lifestyle choices will make a difference in your hba1c level which is good news because that means you have some control however the changes will take time which requires you to create a plan that is easy to follow enjoyable and effective those are my three e's and they are the overarching goal of my freedom health program so if you're looking for a guide to get you to your goal I invite you to check out my program through the links provided thanks so much for watching

a very special different chit chat II a personal video as you guys can see by the title I'm gonna be talking about my weight loss journey and just weight in general this video is playin be pretty long which is why I put it off for so long because I know that there's just way too much to try to cram into one video so you might let me know once you finish watching this video what other videos you guys want to see like related to my weight loss journey and all like the fitness stuff eating all that stuff but I will also link some other videos down below that talk about like what I eat in a day things like that so make sure you guys do check out the description box before you leave the video but yeah that's pretty much it subscribe turn in push notifications let's start with the video okay so I did take notes and act on it but just stuff down because I want to make sure I don't really miss anything but but let's go ahead and start with like the history of my weight and how it all went down after we got married is when I gained a ton of weight honestly I don't I don't know if it was just like well I just didn't care I was eating everything I know a big part of it was that Weston eats very unhealthy now that's about all the blame on him but he grew up eating fast food like 24/7 I didn't grow up that way so he was influencing me and it really does matter like who lean out with and obviously that's my husband my husband is the one that was eating very unhealthy and I was just following his habits like obviously fast food is delicious so I was eating it all the time and not caring though just not realizing at the same time and then I realize I actually did start realizing that I was gaining weight and then when you get to that mentality of like oh my gosh I've already gained 1015 pounds you're like I can't even go back I might a little just keep eating I'm just there's just no like helping the situation so it only got worse and worse so I ended up I don't know for sure just because I did not weigh myself on my way so I have no idea what I weighed but just from knowing myself and like seeing the pictures and stuff I do know that I was weighing a pretty healthy amount and then after I got married that my guess is that I gained us thirty pounds are around there so I was definitely at my heaviest about two and a half years ago I think it's when I was so I was at my absolutely heaviest anytime I took a picture hated looking at it I I didn't like myself I was so unhappy with the way I looked and just the way yeah just overall that you guys don't obviously like I was Anita Grammer and YouTube or like I and the lenses so much and I was getting it from you guys I was like all the comments were literally like oh my gosh she got fat oh my god she's so fat now like have you guys seen the way she looks so it was it was it was a pretty tough year in general to like after being married like it was a tough year I wasn't like I said I was miserable so finally one day it was Whitney Simmons that I was watching I do still absolutely love other stuff even though I don't follow it as much but she talked about her weight loss journey and her just health journey in general and she basically one of the things that like wrong with me and just stuff so when took me to this day it stuck so much and I mentioned this in one of my other videos is that she talked about how it became a lifestyle and just how you have to make it a lifestyle so that was one of the biggest things that I was like okay I guess I guess this is my new life like you just have to make it a lifestyle it's not just two months of crazy workout sessions and two months of crazy healthy eating it's literally like a lifestyle so that's where we'll jump into how I look into fitness so I started with spin it I have done other work hasn't the best nights to do hot yoga which I absolutely loved but some reason spin was like a big thing and this was like a year and a half ago I believe and I started going to a spin studio the first class you guys was hell it was death I hated it I loved feeling like oh my gosh like I can't believe I myself I'm gonna make this a lifestyle and here I am after this class feeling like I can't do that again that was miserable but at the same time it was a slightly fun like I was like if only I was better it would be fun if that makes sense so I won't let the entire week I was like okay it got better even though every single class was still kind of miserable and then after going for like pushing you have to push through those few weeks push for like two three weeks and then after that I was like okay this is actually getting fun still really hard it's don't really hard to not get me wrong and you still need a lot of motivation but it got fun and then you eventually after like the two or three month mark is when it got literally like actually fun where I was like oh my gosh said I'm not dreading going to these classes anymore they're actually super fun so finding a workout that you can see where the fun will come is my biggest kind of advice I know that sounds really weird but some people like I said like yoga you expect me to be like Pilates but like I mentioned it might be held in the beginning you just have to see the light at the end of the tunnel you have to understand that it will be fun the better you get in it so if you can see that then oh my gosh push through those first few weeks push through that first month I've been boxing also which is super fun like there's so many fun classes and okay with the whole classes thing also I do highly suggest that going to an actual studio and so many Studios offer like a first week for free so you can try it out or even like the first class for free and you can try it out as opposed to like go into a gym and taking classes there you're not going to get like top-notch classes which might like deter you from going back so that's one of my suggestion even though I do go to a gym now I did start with the studio which I do highly highly suggest and there's also another amazing app class pass I know allows you to go to different to try them out I would leave that down below not sponsored by any means but I know class pass is an amazing way to try different classes so that's where I started and that was like I said almost two years ago with doing the spin I did it consistently consistently for over six months I would go like five six mates sometimes the entire week not take a single day off and with even after going like six months I had only lost around ten pounds which I know sounds so unmotivated even for me I remember thinking like holy cow because I didn't weigh myself all the time especially in the beginning I rarely weighed myself but after those like six months there was a point where I I did weigh myself and I was like oh wow like I'm 10 pounds lighter I didn't focus on the scale I didn't focus on my weight but seeing those 10 pounds I had already felt good and I hadn't focused on the way that seeing that was it was like wow I can't believe I've been working my ass off for the past six months and only ten pounds down but I did feel so much better and see that I was not toning up so much but just looking slimmer overall even though it looked like it was more than ten pounds I felt like it was more than ten pounds so that was kind of like the main thing was I wasn't focused on the way but I had been around ten pounds maybe a little more and then it fast forward to like another thirty four months I was out like the nine ten month mark I was like working out consistently and doing spend consistently and that's where I finally joined the gym and if you guys have been following like my Instagram and stuff I enjoyed equinox which is a very swanky gym but I did that because I knew that I could be consistent but those are very expensive gym I knew that I can continue going and they offered to spin there they offered different classes like Tabata and like booty workouts and stuff like that which is what I finally wanted to do I first wanted to like drop some weight and then tone up so that was my old goal and it was working out everything was going according to plan I guess you could say so I finally I joined the gym I started taking the classes and after like two or three months I had dropped again another five to ten pounds I was saying like I wasn't weight my football the time so I wasn't sure enough so ma sure but I was toning up for sure I could feel that I was so much stronger literally so after going for probably three four months I remember one day I was taking off my pants like my pajamas and I felt my legs and I was like oh I was like oh my gosh I have muscles in my thighs again little so I know my legs is one of my favorite features that's not to like brag or anything but always like I always felt like my legs never got like the fact they were always more toned up until when I talked about those thirty pounds that I had gained oh my gosh like I could not believe that I knew that and eat so much weight when my legs were no longer my favorite part heated the way my legs looked so when that day when I was seeking out my hands and I was like my legs are feeling like how I used to love them where they felt like muscular and strong was when I was like holy cow I only got more motivating and those like crosses that I had been taking we're really working that I was like oh my gosh like it's all gonna get like everything is working it was it was such a good feeling and when you hit those like milestones is what you really realize like oh my gosh like it's never about the scale and so that everything about how you feel I'm saying that you guys always ask me where my workouts are and I take classes at my gym that's literally all I ever do I sometimes I'll workout at home but that's very very rare because I just I can't ever come up with a good workout and I I just need the group setting some people can work out alone like I said I need that group setting I love seeing like the motivation and like the girl struggling next to me like I feel the same way I'm like I'm struggling with you even though I've been going for so long like we're both of us eating both but we're both pushing through so I just I love group setting and that's just what works for me so that's what I do okay so by then and had already been like it's been like over a year and by that point I think that's a year mark I had lost around 20 pounds that's when I finally was like okay I've lost it about weight I feel so much better I'm getting toned but I still I need that next step so that's where in a minute if you're mitten fasting came in I've talked about intermittent fasting I will link some other videos down below that talked all about like my 180 in a day and how I do intermittent fasting I'm still on the sixteen eight cut where I basically fast for sixteen hours and then I eat during an eight hour window I'm not going to go too much into depth because this video again would be like an hour long but for me it's worked out for many many reasons there's a million reasons why intermittent fasting works for me might not work for you honestly everybody's bodies are different everybody just has different goals and just different lifestyles like honesty or lifestyle it will depend so much on what kind of like diet you can do and for me an intermittent fasting I've been doing it for over six months now and like I said it's just work that's become such a simple lifestyle I don't ever dread it there are some tough days but for the most part it's very very doable and I don't ever dread it so it's just something that's worked for me but that being said okay within a minute Bassam that doesn't mean you can eat whatever you want that was into what I eat now my food I always like I said even back in like high school stuff I've always been pretty like aware of food and what I eat and what happened into my body but in the past year I have learned a lot I've learned that my body doesn't really like sugar too much so I'm always very very conscious and like aware of how much sugar opening in especially what I mean very very like crazy about what I'm eating if I'm not being more flexible and will pay attention to it too much but I am more aware of like how much sugar is in food think sugar eat those natural sugars there's natural sugars in your fruit so even if your Dulci in a ton of fruit you're getting a lot of sugar so things like that to be aware like reading nutrition labels if you really just kind of start teaching yourself and understanding it you will notice and realize that a lot of those things that really don't make sense you don't need although there will always be a ingredients that you don't understand but simpler the ingredient label but easier also another little tip that I don't think everybody knows but the first ingredient that you see in whenever you're eating is the most common or like highest ingredient on this so that's always like a huge thing just know the ingredient labels kind of try to read them and understand them once you start to get the hang of it every time you're out shopping stuff you don't need to read every single label I know for me even now when I go grocery shopping I will still try to read labels foods that I haven't had before because honestly really understanding the foods it's going to make a huge difference and sometimes even when you understand them I will have my bad days and I will have my cheating I have a cheat day like two or three times a week honestly like I don't eat perfectly semester's something that that's just that how my life works I'm not going to restrict myself from every single food because I know that then a little binge eat later so just understanding what works for you I feel like is the that's the way to go about it and trying to learn along the way that will be so much trial and error I know for me also like you go to like a smoothie place and you're top at least smoothies are usually healthy keep in mind there's so much sugar in them because of like all the fruits that's not to say well I won't have a smoothie but I will try to get like saying the fruits that have less sugar are the least sugar and then I'll also make sure that I know what yogurt is going to yogurt you guys can have so much sugar it's insane so or even omitting the yogurt a lot of times if I make my smoothie I hope I will not put you over in it but if I'm going out that's what I have like more my more not so perfectly healthy smoothie and all kind of indulge that way a lot of times when you eat like almond butter there will be like sugars and other stuff in there so make sure when you're buying things like that literally the only ingredient in your home and butter should be almonds 100% raw almonds should be the only ingredient in your almond butter so literally things like that understanding your foods is such a huge huge thing but yeah like I said you will still have your bad days you're not going to eat perfectly that's not just saying that everything is going to be easy and perfect that way but those are all of the things that have helped me I know hopefully this video was somewhat helpful I know that there's so much information in this now I am down 30 pounds so I feel like I'm probably back to where I was when I got married I think but with that I do have a lot more muscle and I am way more toned than I ever was like this is definitely the most fit I've ever been in my life definitely have the most muscle I've ever seen like my legs are 'muscular like there's so much more muscle everywhere we're just so like exciting and fun to see and also don't beat yourself up that's another huge thing do not beat yourself up I know I still do it I will have like one horrible week especially right now we're in the middle of the movie so I'm gonna like going up north or relocating and during those weeks like I don't work out at all and I'll eat anything and I will beat myself up for it and then actually remind myself like snap out of it just go back to the gym it's a new it's a new day it's a new start you can literally turn it around in just one day and then that's what I'll do and then all the really be back on track within that week so little things like that not being yourself but free and just like snapping back into like your healthy lifestyle is gonna be like all the difference in the world that's how it's been for me that's why I've kept the weight off I have down that thirty pounds like I said and I am hoping to lose probably another ten pounds but that will be very very slow even these thirty pounds have been very very slow it's taking me almost two years to lose thirty pounds which sounds crazy because people can do that in the matter of a few months but a lot of times what they do that those few months they don't keep it off so that's just how I've kept it off that's everything that tells me that's every little thing that you guys have probably wanted to know about me and how I've done it I know this video has been highly highly requested but I know that it was a very very long so yeah hopefully you guys enjoyed it if you guys did give it a thumbs up subscribe if you're not subscribed Turner post notifications everything that I talked about will be linked down below that's it Olivia's and I'll see you the next video bye	Low Medical Info

According to a study published on JAMA, nearly 50% of adults living in the U.S. have diabetes or pre-diabetes, a condition where a person already has elevated blood sugar and is at risk to develop diabetes."	6480000.0	PT15M34S	2d	hd	False		0.0			184361.0	6047.0	0.0	334.0	2008-05-17T04:59:56Z	motivationaldoc	808750219.0	hello everyone I want to say welcome on dr. Mandel today we're going to touch on something extremely important I'm going to go ahead and take this off I want to say hello to everyone out there today's topic is going to be about diabetes pre-diabetes increase sugar in our blood which leads to many different types of cardiovascular diseases as well as many types of diseases period throughout the body because the formation increased cholesterol increased triglycerides we're going to be touching upon something about cinnamon it is a miracle spice I want to bring out and mention that the people out there JAMA came out with a study they published something that they say about 50% of adults living in the United States have diabetes or prediabetes now let's explain what pre-diabetes is pre-dated pre-diabetes basically means you don't have diabetes although that you're becoming insulin resistance meaning that when you are eating lots of sugar what's happening is the glucose as being secreted from the pancreas is not allowing the sugar to be assimilated into the cells so when they're not being assimilated into the cells you start getting a buildup of sugar and therefore you start to have pre-diabetes now diabetes basically goes by numbers in it but if your your numbers are not so high but they're staying higher than what we call normal or high normal then you are what they say pre-diabetic so I want to bring out something that's extremely important when we talk about this because with our diet the way that we exercise as many of us don't our poor eating habits the way we are eating certain types of foods and the quantity of food this can cause significant problems with us affecting our insulin levels obviously when the pancreas starts to become overtaxed the pancreas doesn't function and that leads to diabetes now diabetes is important understand because as you start building up extra sugar that sugar turns into triglycerides and those glycerides start forming and plaquing in the arteries and it starts to grow and starts to clump usually people who are diabetic have a higher tendency to have higher cholesterol levels which which brings in more sticky stuff into the intestine to the vessels so our purpose here is to bring out a very miraculous spice and many people have heard about this but I will go into depth in this so you can understand a little bit about it and understand that you're doing it correctly so my job here is to not only educate you but hopefully give you a better thorough understanding that you're doing it correctly let's just talk a little bit about these particular cinnamon things but before I go into that let me just talk there are several studies out there there's one particular study I want to bring out 2012 this was in China they took this particular this research here they noticed that what they did is they took 69 Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes or blood glucose levels above recommended targets or the a1 C's over 7% excuse me the the a1c s primarily means that what your what your sugar has been at level of to the last two to three months so when they look at your any one C level you're looking they're looking to see how much or how high your your cells are carrying sugar or the last couple months and gives doctors a better awareness of what you've been doing before just doing a routine blood work but what they wrote the research did was they they put it into three groups they took one group 120 milligrams of cinnamon a day before breakfast a high dose group took 360 milligrams and the other group was a see Bogra group what they gave nothing they were taking their medication and they added this particular spice and they noticed that the placebo group had no results and both groups that took the cinnamon had significant lower sugar levels not only that the a1c levels came down not only that but they've also noticed that this can also affect cholesterol so there are significant studies and I don't want to really bore you going through all the studies because I really did a lot of homework that this will lower LDL s your low-density lipoproteins this will lower total cholesterol and it will lower triglycerides now that is pretty powerful if you can get something that can lower it that is like a miracle now I know this works because I have many doctor friends who have actually taught me a lot I have a very close nutrition friend who's who does a lot of traveling I have significant close friends who have family who have diabetes and many of these people have responded very well to cinnamon now I want to explain that when you take cinnamon which I will explain to you how to take it I want you to make sure that if you are taking medication oral medication or you're taking insulin you need to communicate with your doctor okay so let me just go into this this is very important people are saying well what do I take how much of this stuff do I take what is it all about what kind of cinnamon there are two kinds of sentiments the two kinds of synonyms sentiments are the cassia cinnamon and the sell on cinnamon the cassia cinnamon comes from I'm going to go in there from southern China and it's also known as Chinese cinnamon and this particular cinnamon is a lower quality okay it's more of a cheaper quality this cinnamon you may find this more in supermarkets this has been used for uh flea for cooking and doing things at home give you a little spice the bottom line is as cassia cinnamon is the most common variety but I just want to bring out that the important thing is it has a high coumarin content so if you look at this the high Coomer and content basically means that if you have any type of liver kidney or problems going on this can irritate livers if you have liver problems I recommend you speak with your doctors before you do anything but this is not the one I'm going to recommend I just have to let you know that taking this in high doses can affect your liver and there has been side effects on that let's talk about the the sale on the sale on kueh cinnamon this is a true cinnamon this is in Sri Sri Lanka in southern parts of India many of our chat room right now who live in India will understand this and this is a tan brown color this is less common and has been long prized as a cooking spice it's quite more expensive but the bottom line is its high-quality and it has a milder flavor now I want to bring out because I'm going to kind of skip things to move things quick as I talked about the the coumarin this can be very toxic in humans particularly kidney liver and lung but we are not going to recommend this to you all right so the bottom line is that the salon cinnamon is the number one choice and I want to go over and share a few important things with you right about now so understand we're talking about how much of this can you take well I'm going to go over that with you right now I'm going to go over some important things with you let me just pull this up let me just show you a few things here while I'm on the topic to show you a little bit of what it looks like these are things you can get off Amazon the Ceylon cinnamon if you notice it says 1200 milligrams in this bottle these are two capsules they generally come in 500 or 600 milligrams if you look here this is a by the way carlson is one of the greatest omega-3 companies so I put them up there because I'm sure all their stuff is notice on the bottle helps maintain normal blood glucose levels okay you'll see that I'm mostly all this stuff on this one supports heart health supports lower cholesterol supports blood sugar management look at what they're saying here because this is the research and people I want you to know one thing that we have to have the best quality now if you look at this this is a greater and I'm going to tell you that from the method one of the best ways to get the best quality of this particular miracle spice is to grade it yourself so if you have good quality stick cinnamon sticks and you can do it yourself excellent most people may not be able to do that but I'm going to show you a couple of things here's a cinnamon powder freshly grounded looks like a great powder you can get this on Amazon or other companies you can search it on the internet if you have the powder and pertaining to how much you should take they recommend a little more than a teaspoon four grams is one teaspoon they say no more than six grams so you can split that up throughout the day or pertaining to the capsules you have to base it on the quality that you're getting but the average is one to two capsules which is 5 to 600 milligrams they talked about the cinnamon sticks I say about one stick per day I'll actually want to bring out something that's interesting here one second another very important way they say that you can take it as a tea a lot of people may notice that they have peas that have the cinnamon tea in it you notice it has the Ceylon cinnamon already the seat the teabag in there already the way it is add a little ginger to it very healthy for you that is another way of taking they say you can use it into a black tea you can use the cinnamon bark oil and you can actually put drops one two three drops there are many different ways of using this and I'm not really going to go into all the different ways you can actually Google this but I think the most common way is the cinnamon sticks by grating it getting fresh powder or getting the fresh cinnamon powder already packaged or getting the capsules now if it was me I'm a capsule guy I don't like to sit there and make things all day I'm not that traditional but I know that there are very good companies out there and I recommend to review the reviews and find a good company and you can start adding that to your diet now remember this will bring down bad cholesterol will bring down the LDLs bring down triglycerides this will help you bring down sugar levels but I do recommend all of you to check with your doctors particularly if you are on any kind of medication and I also recommend to stay with the the Ceylon cinnamon I think it's the safest it's the most effective and the studies that I have read are all with this particular cinnamon bark which is a Ceylon cinnamon I really hope that this gave you a little bit of understanding pertaining to this cinnamon type of thing I think it's something that's really important you know there are people out there it's a major major epidemic diabetes is just growing and growing and growing and growing and it usually grows more with obesity so the first thing I would tell everyone to do is don't just do the herbs that I tell you to do start losing the weight drink lots of fluids start getting exercise start start eating correctly start walking more than taking the elevators and the escalators and start making it a thing of your life to really start taking good care of yourself watch those fried foods so it's high cholesterol saturated fats watch those trans fatty foods don't eat those big meals before you go to bed and just be aware what you're doing I really think that this will help you because I can tell you that you will maintain better sugar levels within your bloodstream by just losing weight and watching your diet lots of fruits lots of vegetables when the best things that you can do is start adding in more fiber fiber slows that exchange of sugar that tries to gets into the cells quickly in other words it slows egg that fast glycemic index as we'd say if someone has a straight sugar and you take sugar and you have it with with fiber the fiber slows the metabolism down which will not give you that big spike so uses use this information do your

And I had no idea. A little bit embarrassed, but... I did my research, and that's why I wore number 16, was because of Mr. Clarke, and someone that's a legend in our game. Just kind of the man, so I looked up to him, and I was like... Jeez, like... When... When someone says... you can do something, and then when someone shows you you could do something, that's two very different things. So, I saw he could do it, and I was like man, I thought about that guy every single day. So I saw what he did for me, and now I'm just trying to do as much as I can, for whatever community it may be now. I mean, life will throw some sort of challenges and some curveballs at you once in a while, but... You're always measured by how you handle those curveballs thrown at you, so... It's been a lot of fun. Fun journey, and I've still got a long way to go, so... I'm gonna continue to have that voice, and make the most of it. This is Orion. You guys met him before, but... He's not exactly a guard dog, but... Close enough to it, I guess. Hey buddy? Say what's up!Okay, come here. His collar now, is... He's all Habs. I think he wanted to show you guys his new little coat that we got him. We haven't put it on yet, so we'll mess around with that. What, buddy?Hey! Sit! Down. Stay. It's like... I don't even know if it's going to fit him. We'll try it on after. He is legit smarter than I am, again. Does not say much, at all, but... When... when he's on, he's... I mean, obviously like this stuff's cool. Like, I mean... His ability to follow commands, and the fact he's always by my side is pretty special, but... The coolest thing is the fact that he can detect my blood sugar, so... How that works, is... You actually give off a different scent in your saliva, based off of if your blood sugar is high or low. And he was trained before he even met me, as a puppy... after he got all the obedience stuff done, with that scent. So how... basically I know now, is just from different behavior. So this thing right here... It looks like a dog toy kind of thing, but I would wear it on my right hip if I was in public with him. And he's always on my left hip. So if I am low, or high... He'll actually cut me off, because again, like, he's not supposed to break any rules and he always stays on the left hip. If he cuts me off or acts differently at all, and grabs this. He'll sit there and look at me, his mouth like that. And I'll test my blood, and he's right legit like... 99.9% of the time. There's so many variables in my life as... as a diabetic. And... if I'm sick... if I have a lack of sleep, or I eat a different meal, or I eat too late, or something's different... That'll throw off my blood sugar. So routine is like everything for me. Everything I do is like... has to be boom, boom, boom. So yeah, this is my blood sugar, and I'm 7.5. Which is wheelhouse for post-workout. And then, lactate is 8.0, and it was 18.8 at the end. So like, again. I mean, at the start we didn't have this kind of... Like, these kind of results, but... When I have this kind of stuff, I know I'm gonna recover well, versus if I were to go low, of course I can, I mean, bounce back from that. Or high, same thing. We'll find a way around it. But like, this is like optimal. Especially because I'm going to skate now. So you need to have your blood sugar like, consistent. So now I have to go refuel and eat, recover. Get ready to go for the next workout, and...Kind of on repeat, so... That's how it works. Stay. Watch.Stay. Okay! Yeah, 'Okay, come on, let me go!' And then like... If you like... Something like...This is like, structured... But then if I say 'free'... Like, he'll just do whatever he wants. Hey! You're free!Okay, you're good! Go! He loves to like, roll around, too. I don't really like having him around other dogs, because... So say like, if some dog were to like, attack him, because he's such a friendly dog... He'll just kind of let a dog do whatever. So as soon as that happens, like... if... If any dog like, is aggressive, or any type of like... I mean, bark or yap or bite, potentially. That could ruin his training. It could like, spook him a little bit. So he's like, not supposed to be around other dogs, for that reason. But he has been, and he's like, the most gentle dog in the world. Hey bud! You have lots of friends? One more? And then we'll go home? Yeah. You want dinner? You're so cute! Hey!Down. Go get it!	Low Medical Info

In September, 2011, I fell ill with Severe Idiopathic Gastroparesis, and overcame it in 10 months, even though it is not curable. This video is a personal recovery, and is only backed by my own experiences, along with the success I had with naturopathic remedies, chinese remedies, acupuncture, and a change in diet.

I created this video to give hope to others suffering with gastrointestinal disorders. I would like to add, that once I could finally eat again in June 2012, I created my own version of the hunter-gatherer diet. Please see the following link for a video created by a Dr. Terry Wahls who had MS for 7 years, and this diet cured her MS when the best medical treatment didn't. 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLjgBLwH3Wc

It was shortly after I started this diet that my iron levels were quickly restored and my headaches and constant tiredness disappeared. For me, eating heme-iron, and not just non-heme iron, was very important for my body. It is found in meat, fish and poultry, and is the form of iron that is most readily absorbed from your stomach and taken up into your body after you eat it. Today, I can eat anything I want, but still prefer a healthy, well balanced diet.

Please contact me at curegastroparesis@gmail.com if you have any personal questions, but please remember that I am just 18 years old without any formal training. I just had an experience and was not prepared to let a disease change who I was and who I wanted to be.

Thanks and hope this helps,

Mattson a well-known naturopathic doctor who was has written a very informative book called eating alive - we've lived here for generations and generations we've all throughout these generations we've been eating the certain local foods and he's saying stick to that nobody used to get these crazy diseases dr. Mattson then give me some natural Pathak remedies and put me on an extremely restrictive diet which completely eliminated sugar dairy raw vegetables caffeine and yeast shortly afterwards I was able to digest small portions of vegetable broth and wheat free crackers these were the starting signs of progress for me at this point I discontinued taking any more of the Western medicine in the beginning of March I was referred to dr. Qi who is one of the top Chinese doctors in Canada he told me that my stomach energy and my liver energy were not working as one I had no idea that the like how rigid my fingernails were apparently that told me all about what I was deficient in and all about my liver which wasn't working properly so it was just it was definitely eye-opening how interconnected everything was by the end of April I was still not completely cured and not able to digest protein even if it was blended into soup so I can't in my research I came across an article that said some people do not produce enough stomach acid which can cause numerous digestive disorders this is called hypo clear idea and arises when the stomach has difficulty producing hydrochloric acid I learned that hypo clear idea is often overlooked as a cause of many digestive disorders and doctors typically do not look for it nor do they test for it one of the recommended treatments for hypochlorite eeeh was to take betaine hydrochloride a product used as a source of hydrochloric acid which we promptly ordered off the internet around the same time I also learned that I barrel gassed a liquid formulation of herbs was very effective for regulating peristalsis along with treating bloated stomachs and various symptoms of GERD I read about two specific types of beans Hmong and adzuki beans which are very high in protein and very easy to digest when mixed with rice I started drinking beet kvass and eating unpasteurized sauerkraut and both immediately started controlling some of my symptoms I am proud and happy to say that I have not taken any natural Pathak remedies Chinese medicine or had any acupuncture treatments since last June and can eat pretty much anything I want since school ended in June 2012 I have traveled extensively through Europe which has sparked my interest in European universities with the full intention on going to medical school I believe that all medical disciplines have their place including Western medicine naturopathic medicine and acupuncture [Music] gastroparesis and GERD have been cured and I'm forever grateful that it is behind me please share this video because the more people who view it the greater the chance that my story will make a difference [Music] you [Music]	Low Medical Info

and one other thing is that I'm a man of God and so then one of the things that I do neglected to do in my other videos so this is my little advertisement for God is it praying to God helps you notice an old saying and I think it applies to people that have diabetes that have retinopathy - have neuropathy and there was an Akkar TuneIn in the Second World War where two soldiers were sitting in a foxhole as they were being bombarded by the enemy and it says in in the foxhole there are no atheists and praying to God does help I prayed it helped so that's my advertisement for that so the title of this is securi retinopathy in two weeks is it possible to do that absolutely now will the damage being done possible okay because what it talks about is the blood vessels in the eye being weak and there are some supplements that will help with that it will also help with the some of the issues with the toxins irritating the nerves in the eye okay so I'm sorry that I neglected to make this video and I expect to get a great deal of heat from people saying you can't your retina pathy in two weeks so I hate to tell you you can make a big difference let me tell you how the most important thing is to get rid of the toxins three major ways to do it one is to help the toxins out the door there's a number of different things you can do there's people that talk about zeolites there's people to talk about greens here's people are talking about fiber and this has to do with constipation and some of the other things so I'll put a link into Chinese medicine where they talk about getting rid of the constipation because if you have everything working to get rid of toxins but you don't get rid of them they come right back they get reabsorbed okay so getting rid of toxins through supplements doing exercise it really talks what exercise is one of the things that people don't talk about is how exercises induces Auto fogging to go to caveman MD I think I'll put a link takes going to take me a while to put that up I wanted to put this up so people that needed to take to get started getting better could do that the things I talked about are easy to do okay don't require a lot of money and you can and you can test to see that they're working they talk about alkaline water some of that so the guy that asked about the alkaline water asked how I came on to this and I said well I went to some meetings about kangen water they were trying to sell me a four thousand dollar machine so he gave me a lot of information and made demonstrations and show that there is a connection between alkaline water and toxin building up in your in yourself and alkaline water helps the Plus the cells of toxins okay and exercise if you do it for about a half hour and get your heart rate up yes you can induce on a foggy and that's when the body goes looking for other material besides [¬†__¬†] glucose to break down through ketosis and other means into simple sugar so the body can use it there's something called intermittent fasting you do intermittent fasting dr. Mercola I'll find a link for him there's Cape and MD okay my is a written fasting for a little different I think it's more effective but I could be biased so those are the things okay so let me go on and talk to you about supplements okay vitamin C I don't know if I tell you I have a scar on my arm right here okay I put aloe vera on it and you can take a libero it doesn't taste very good but I put I took vitamin C and the scar is about in one day has gotten half the size I take root R u TI n most people don't get any but what it does is that it strengthens the small capillaries one source of that is buckwheat I don't know how many people eat buckwheat not very many I don't believe sometimes the buckwheat pancakes yeah should do that but I take a supplement because I want to get I'm taking it because I have a diabetic wound and I want to small capillaries can regrow faster okay so okay been a feta mean it's a fat soluble vitamin b6 you can take b6 and this will help if you go look up the sentence of vitamin b6 if the identical match for the symptoms of beriberi for neuropathy your symptoms are the same as for beriberi which is caused by a lack of vitamin b6 alpha lipoic acid another supplement our alpha lipoic acid another supplement that's more expensive so if you don't have a lot of money like it was like when I bought it to test it it was 30 bucks I found Swanson's has it for about eight or nine and I bought that to try it out too now going through it I go to Trader Joe's and I buy greens and I have them in my salad and okay so let's see oh you want to so now we go on to food and you eat food to give you both chlorophyll and fiber which you need in higher amounts and normal people and most people that are diabetic or overweight that are overweight because they don't have enough fiber in the system so that's the quick story I've taken about almost 14 minutes of your time so I won't take any more you can send me an email I am looking I think I would like to do some sort of written things so people could get the word out figure out what they can do for themselves and so that I wouldn't have to make videos like this anyway thank you very much if you know somebody or if you want to help make a book about this please let me know thank you very much for your attention	Low Medical Info

Do you still have high blood sugar in the morning, even without consuming sugar? Here‚Äôs what you need to know.
¬†
Timestamps
0:20 Gluconeogenesis¬†
0:50 Why does this happen?¬†
1:20 The dawn phenomenon¬†
1:40 Insulin
2:15 Blood sugar¬†
3:18 What you can do¬†

Today we‚Äôre going to talk about why you might have high blood sugar in the morning even though you‚Äôve had zero sugar. You might even have your first meal and notice that your blood sugar levels actually go down. What‚Äôs up with that?

Your liver is actually what‚Äôs making the sugar. The name for this is called gluconeogenesis. The liver is making new sugar out of protein, ketones, or fat.¬†

Everyone has a little bit of this going on. To an extent, this is a normal reaction due to hormone fluctuations. To a very small degree, you‚Äôll have blood sugar fluctuations throughout the night and throughout the day. But, when you have too much of this, it‚Äôs called the dawn phenomenon.¬†

The dawn phenomenon is a situation where you wake up, and your blood sugars are too high. This is likely due to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance makes the dawn phenomenon a lot worse.¬†

All of this goes back to insulin, which stores fat, and is supposed to keep gluconeogenesis from happening. When you have insulin resistance, in certain parts of your body, you don‚Äôt have enough insulin. But, in other parts of the body, you have too much insulin.¬†

A normal blood sugar level is about 80. This would mean you have about 1 level teaspoon of sugar in all of your blood or 5 grams. For every 10 points that your blood sugar goes up, that‚Äôs an increase of 1/2 gram. If your blood sugar is 120 in the morning, this means you have an extra 2 grams of sugar in all of your blood. This is not an outrageous amount that will cause a lot of problems.¬†

What you can do if you have high blood sugar in the morning:

1. Give it time
2. Take things to speed up the process (potassium, magnesium, zinc, and vitamin B12)
3. Exercise (walk for about 20 minutes)¬†

We really have worked hard at trying to establisha neuropathy relief center at our clinic. What we‚Äôre after is to try to give the patient,besides just the normal pharmaceutical treatment that you can get at most of the doctors aroundthat just give you a pill to take and it makes you feel a little better, but really doesn‚Äôtsolve the problem - we try to give you solutions to get your neuropathy better, to improvethem. We‚Äôve invested a lot in trying to learnabout supplements and the role that they play, using pharmaceuticals appropriately to giveyou relief, using electrical nerve signal therapy with local anesthetic block to tryand regenerate nerves, laser therapy has been very effective at helping nerves get better- not just feel better, but also get better. Also, there‚Äôs surgery, in the right person. Sometimes nerves are pinched in associationwith having neuropathy the nerves can be entrapped, just like carpal tunnel syndrome can causepain under you hand, the same thing can happen in your foot and lower extremity, so by decompressingthose nerves, you can have significant relief and dramatically improve nerve function, andin the case of patients with diabetes, much lower risk of future diabetic foot ulcers,and that‚Äôs been demonstrated by a lot of studies that have been done. How supplements work basically is, a lot ofthem are geared towards helping the cell, the nerve cell, have enough energy. The nerve cells in general are very high energyconsumers, and they‚Äôre very small, very long, skinny nerves and if they don‚Äôt haveenough energy, they can‚Äôt heal themselves and repair themselves or maintain this electro-gradientthat‚Äôs across the nerve. For example, how a nerve carries an impulseis there‚Äôs an electrical current and there‚Äôs a little gate that opens and lets calciumin and out of the cell, and it creates an electrical current across this nerve. To establish that, the cell has to pump thatcalcium out to keep that gradient there. It has to work all of the time, and what happenswhen you get not enough energy, those gates just stay open, the nerve doesn‚Äôt functionand you start getting feelings like burning, tingling, electrical sensation, and eventuallynumbness because the nerve doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve actually had patients who I‚Äôve operatedon without local anesthetic and they haven‚Äôt felt it a bit because they‚Äôre so profoundlyneuropathic - their nerves are so far damaged that they don‚Äôt feel anything. That‚Äôs a major cause of falls, it‚Äôs amajor cause of ulcers, it‚Äôs a major cause of calluses - I‚Äôve had patients break theirfeet and not feel it - they come in and they have a swollen, red foot and they don‚Äôtknow why, and you take x-rays and they have all of these fractures inside of their foot. There are ways, if you catch it early enough,and use the right supplements and keep your blood sugar down, that you can preserve yournerve function until late in life and have a healthy life.

that I'm presenting I will show you a link at the end of the presentation that you can have access to for a teaching purpose we obviously have various agents that manage diabetes because both is throughout the body and there's various organs that are involved in its metabolism so just a brief review of what's available currently metformin obviously is the mainstay of treatment the first slide and its role is really in improving insulin sensitivity decreasing hepatic glucose production but there's been a couple of new tools that we have in our toolbox over the years cell phone areas have been around a long time they work on the pancreas to increase insulin secretion and the newer classes and medications have focused on other areas where we can manipulate sugar utilization and uptake in order to prevent hyperglycemia and among those are the incra 10th class of medications so that goes without reason without saying that farm companies have looked at other areas and kidney has been really relatively untouched up until this time we know that glucose is filtered through the kidney and a significant proportion of it's reabsorbed so now we have a new agent which are the sglt2 inhibitors that work at this level in a unique way separate from all the other agents that we have to decrease hyperglycemia so how does it work well there are two different receptors SGL t1 and sglt2 sul t2 is two predominant one at the level of the nephron and it is involved in reabsorbing predominantly most of the glucose that's filtered through the kidney and then SGL t1 is working mostly at the gut there is some in the kidney as well and surprisingly a little bit in the in the heart as well but its role there is not really well described so as shell t2 inhibitors work at the kidney to prevent that reabsorption of the filtered glucose and you end up essentially urinating out all of the filtered glucose that is handled by the kidney that works most at the proximal segment and glucose is filtered through and then lost through the urine with the action of these agents not all of the glucose is lost approximately 50% of filtered glucose will end up being acted upon by this particular class of medications so the rationale of using these agents and diabetes is that it will improve your sugar control if you're not retaining sugar and you're losing it you will see less hyperglycemia and the other side benefit is that if you're not keeping that caloric content you will also see some weight loss it's acts independently of insulin so we're not trying to act on this poor tired pancreas to keep on pouring out extra insulin and that's always a good thing there's potentially less risk for things like hypoglycemia because you're not again working through an insulin dependent mechanism and it seems like it would be compatible with other medications because it's a unique mechanism of action and as you are inducing an osmotic diuresis you should see some benefit in blood pressure as well so we do have several agents that are available now in Canada one the first one out of the gate is canna Cliff losen which is also known as invokana that's been out for about a year and a half now and then followed by dapple Closen which is far Zika and most recently empathy blouson which is Guardians they work well I'll tell you exactly how well in a second and they are indicated in combination with other agents including insulin as long as there's no contraindication to their use and the main content occation is you have to have good kidney function or an SMA GFR of greater than 60 disadvantages is that you see more sugar in the urinary tract along with that more signs of infection both urinary and genital infections predominantly in women these are usually manageable with regular one of the male medications that you would use to treat UTIs and yeast infections the other downside is potentially too much of an affect on blood pressure due to the osmotic diuresis and the big one on the bottom here is the increased incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis which has really come about post-marketing we're seeing more of that in both type 1 and type 2 it's not indicated for use in type 1 diabetes however people still use it in type 1 diabetes and in type 2 diabetes it's been a bit of a surprise how frequently we're seeing diabetic ketoacidosis FDA and Health Canada have put out a warning that there is an increased risk and locally we've certainly seen many cases and we've in the process of publishing a case series on the Ottawa a cohort of diabetic ketoacidosis with type 2 diabetics on this class of medications so they work not surprisingly a1c does get lowered on its own you're probably looking at a point seven percent reduction in hemoglobin a1c so compared to your other agents for diabetes not a great reduction a modest reduction and added on top of other regularly used medications you do see a complementary effect so an additional effect and you do see some weight changes although we're not talking about a hundred pound weight loss here we're talking about on average around two to three kilograms of weight loss and again if you're using it with other weight loss promoting medications you may see more weight loss things like the increase in class of medication and metformin nope that was the story until about September ESD is sort of the second main diabetes conference we have in the diabetes world the first is 88 and usually yes D doesn't really present a whole lot of new data most of that gets taken up by a DA in June so surprisingly EAS D this year in September came out with a breaking news that this new medication M flows in has been showed to reduce cardiovascular deaths and since then everybody is talking about this study which is the emperor egg study and it really is taken over sort of the diabetes literature I've been to several conferences since September and that's all everybody's talking about and I'm sure this weekend at IDF that's going to be the main topic as well so how does implicit flows and work well it is an sglt2 inhibitors and that may be important when we start talking about is this a class effect versus is there something unique about this particular medication it does cost glucose reduction by causing renal glucose excretion and in type 2 diabetes it does lead to a1c reduction weight loss as well as reduction in blood pressure without a significant increase in heart rate the emperor egg study was designed as a non-inferiority study now that we have sort of guidelines for diabetes medication to prove that it is safe from a cardiac standpoint all diabetes medications have to go through this process a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial and the objective was to examine the long-term effects of epical close and versus placebo in addition to standard care on cardiac morbidity mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes an existing high risk of cardiovascular events it was done worldwide 590 sites in 42 countries over 7,000 patients enrolled and there were randomized into three arms placebo EMPA at a low dose of 10 milligrams versus Empire high dose of 25 milligrams this was added to standard care so other diabetes medications were used they just didn't they shouldn't have been adjusted in the 12 weeks prior to enrollment the key inclusion criteria type 2 diabetic so no type one's BMI less than 45 I think that's pretty it's gonna capture both of your type 2 diabetic patients a 1c pretty wide range 7 to 10% the mean came out to about 8 point something and there has to be established cardiovascular disease so a prior mi coronary artery disease stroke on stable angina etc and the key exclusion criteria is a low EGFR so the primary outcome was this 3 point may system where you had time to first occurrence to cardiovascular death non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke and the secondary outcome was a four point mace which included hospitalization for unstable angina looking at the baseline characteristics this is people I see every day there's nothing that really stands out so the mean age is around sixty as in a lot of studies mostly male spread out throughout the world a once II mean was eight point oh eight percent and the key here to note is that these were patients who had diabetes for a while so most of them over have had had diabetes for over ten years again very typical of the type of patients that I would see as an endocrinologist and they were all on various different glucose lowering agents metformin was used a lot which would make sense with all of the guidelines suggesting its first-line use and other thing to note is that insulin was also used quite frequently so about half of the patients in this study were also on insulin so again we're not we're not dealing with a milder diabetic someone who's had at recent onset in terms of cardiovascular disease again a hodgepodge but as you would expect with this high-risk population significant amount have had a history of a prior mi about half and heart failure about ten percent so not perhaps as high as you might think given some of the results I'm gonna show you later they were all on good medications so you know there's always the argument with these newer cardiac mortality studies is well you know the era post ACE inhibitor statins are you really gonna see that much of a benefit in a three-year trial of a diabetes medication well these patients were on you know significantly a significant portion proportion of them were already on Lipper lowering medication statins aasa and i didn't show you the blood pressure data but they were all pretty well control for their blood pressure with a mean systolic blood pressure about 135 so the not surprising results to start off with so a 1c reduction as I showed you with the previous sglt2 inhibitors data you do see an a1c reduction you see an a1c reduction that is modest about 0.7% and that's what we saw in this trial and the nice thing is that you you see that with both of the doses low dose and high dose wait fit was a again modest weight reduction about two three kilogram weight loss not huge but considering the natural history of diabetics is that they will gain weight over time it is always nice to see a diabetes medication that does not promote weight gain which has been the case up until the recent years the Stalag blood pressure there was a blood pressure reduction again you know you can argue whether this is significant or not I think it is significant we're seeing about anywhere from at the big you know middle of the trial versus the end anywhere from a 3 to 5 millimeter mercury reduction and systolic blood pressure there was sort of a neutral but maybe even a adverse effect on LDL cholesterol so you can see sort of towards the middle part here that LDL levels were higher in those treated with empathy losen towards the end of the trial it kind of the the curves kind of overlap a little bit it's balanced off by a also a mild increase in HDL cholesterol and and you know these are in milligrams per deciliter but they're pretty close to what we would consider target for our type-2 diabetic population so LDL the mean was around 2.1 and HDL we're talking about it mean about 1.1 millimoles per liter so here's where the surprising results came in so when it when they looked at the primary outcome cardiovascular death the epical closing group did significantly better and the Hazards ratio was 0.6 so even though was designed as a non-inferiority trial because it was such a significant p-value and i don't understand all the stats about but my what I've read and what the explanation has been is that if you have that degree of a significant p-value it now can turn into a superiority trial so this drug did have a benefit and the other big thing that's been really talked about quite extensively is how quickly those two curves separate right from the onset so really we're not seeing a separation at 12 weeks which is what you typically would expect if we're talking about some more long-term metabolic changes like LDL or glucose but really really early on within weeks we're seeing a separation of the two curves and the curves continue to separate over the course of the trial it was not a big difference between the low dose and the high dose they both showed a superiority maybe a little bit more with a higher dose and when you divide it up into your your different primary outcomes it really was the death the cardiovascular to be such a significant number so the other big thing that came out was hospitalization for heart failure so when they looked at that independently with the group that was treated with this medication there was a similar separation of the curve when it comes to hospitalization for heart failure so this was a bit surprising I showed you the baseline data they had a 10% pop pre-existing history of heart failure in the baseline population and to get this degree of a significance at the endpoint is pretty remarkable we knew next question is what was driving that cardiovascular death was a death from heart failure that really improved this group it really wasn't I mean they looked at sort of the different things that the people actually passed away from and it was a mixed bag you know MI sudden death arrhythmia there was a 40% unspecified cardiac cardiovascular death category so that may somehow be you know directing the results one way or the other so that's certainly something that could be unexplained there there's been some literature that suggests that maybe certain types of arrhythmias are ventricular arrhythmias are included in that unspecified group and maybe that's what drove the the reduction so the summary of this trial is that it reduce the total risk for the three point Mesa primary outcome by 14% it did improve glycemic control although nobody believes that it was a glycemic control that caused this degree of positive cardiac outcomes we haven't seen that with any of the other diabetes trials in the past and the in the effect was so early on that it really would be unexpected if it is related to glucose lowering there is reduction in weight and blood pressure so that certainly is quite positive and there may be a small increase in LD on HDL that perhaps balance each other out the empik low flows n was increased with some side of what's associate some side effects not unexpected genital infections but although I was pretty well tolerated they didn't see an increased risk of DKA in this large trial of 7,000 people so that's again quite positive where we're seeing really quite a bit of DKA with some of the other classes of medication other medications in this class it reduced the heart failure by hostile ization for heart fail by 35 percent reduced cardiovascular death by 38 percent an improved survival by by reducing all cause mortality by 32 percent so the key features here it's a high risk cardiovascular population with modest hyperglycemia mean a1c 8% already on standard glucose lowering therapy 50% of them already on insulin and 97% of patients complete the study was well tolerated and the low dose versus high dose did not really show a big difference so you can really safely use a low dose of the medication and really get a lot of bang for the buck so when you look at sort of the the net effect in this trial for three years in 1,000 patients with type 2 diabetes 25 lives were saved 22 fewer cardiovascular deaths 14 fewer hospitalizations for heart failure 53 additional genital infections so number needed to treat looking at when statins first came out this is the 4s study with simvastatin for 5.4 years a number needed a treat was about 30 then came on the ACE inhibitor so hope trial number needed to treat was about 56 and now we have implica flows in a number needed to treat was 39 so again really unexpected and quite remarkable for a diabetes medication so the next question is why why are we seeing this effect in this particular diabetes medication and there's been lots of hypotheses floating around it likely does have something to do with the diaeresis effect of this medication because you are causing purposely that osmotic diuresis at the kidney you're going to see fluid that's being lost you're gonna see an improvement in blood pressure and there may be other unexplained mechanisms that we don't know yet they've looked in the heart there are no sglt2 inhibitors Majel t to receptors at the heart level so it's not a direct receptor effect but there may be other mechanisms related with the vasculature now up until this point the meta analyses of intensive glucose control and type 2 diabetes has been somewhat less than impressive so really with mostly driven by studies like Accord and VAD T really we're not seeing benefits in terms of intensive glucose lowering so at best we're seeing a neutral effect and and maybe if we interfere with less emic management early on with metformin you may see a positive fact much later on with a UKPDS we're talking about 10 20 years later on you're seeing a benefit and cardiovascular outcomes so this is clearly different so that's why we don't think this is really related to sugar lowering on its own the next question is is all sglt2 inhibitors created equal well we don't know okay so the studies are are coming 2017 I believe with DAPA glue flows in and then kanika flows and I believe so 2017 those trials will be finishing up and we should hopefully see similar effects but there are some subtle Pharma kinetic differences between these medications in terms of selectivity for that sglt2 receptors so again at at this time it really is only this particular medication that should be used in a high-risk cardiac population if you're hoping to see this kind of benefit so where does this fit in our algorithm for managing diabetes well nothing's gonna replace metformin that's that's really our first line that's been out there for a long time with good evidence on safety so really a first line with anybody with type 2 diabetes metformin should be used unless there's a contract occasion however when it comes to the add-on therapies you are going to choose the agent that's best suited to the individual and it could be dependent on the degree of hyperglycemia so if someone's a1c is 11% on metformin you're not going to choose this medication because it's not gonna lower the sugar enough and in that setting where they're so catabolic li- they're losing so much sugar is there going to be any additional benefit of a medication like this I don't know so I think really it's best used in that specific population with pretty stable diabetes modest elevation and a1c who has those features of higher cardiovascular risk so just is just highlighting the things I've talked about adding the second agent and hypoglycemia management and reduction is always very important because there is independently associated risk of death with hypoglycemia severe hypoglycemic events in diabetes so definitely something to always be on the lookout for I promise these are the slides so if you go under emperor egg you'll be able to find them and I thank you	High Medical Info

I've just graduated from University last June I have been diabetic since the age of eleven and I am insulin dependent and currently taking sections five times a day I was diagnosed when my mum read something about the symptoms and signs of diabetes in a magazine and then I started drinking more needing to go to the toilet more at school I am psyched falling asleep really early was more grumpy than usual things like that so she then took me down to the doctor's surgery and they did one quick blood test and and that was it my daily routine is a bit different someone without diabetes I have to wake up do a blood test have some insulin for my food I can't really miss breakfast and so you have to make sure even if I wake up late I have to make sure I can fit in breakfast then repeat the process of injecting and blood testing at lunch and dinner and then I also have to inject before I go to bed depending on how busy my day is or what I'm doing sometimes I don't do that all the blood tests I'm supposed to very occasionally I don't do what the insulin I'm supposed to and I probably could look after myself a bit better but I'm coming to the age now where I'm trying to do that at school and since really every time you have to inject or do a blood test you get lots of questions you get lots of reactions like oh no that's horrible look how big that needle is and it's really not it's just like a five millimeter needle and for me it's part of everyday life but they all make a big fuss about it which does get on my nerves a little bit it almost seems like there's a constant need to justify what you're doing which makes it harder to let it become part of daily life at school it wasn't just my fellow pupils that I had issue is I also had issues with teachers as well who you would think were a bit more educated in the area but they aren't always I once had a maths teacher who was I had a hypo in class and it got surreptitiously got some of my Luke's aid tablets out to deal with that he thought I was eating sweets and he said to the headmaster when I protested that I wasn't so he did get Stern turning off afterwards I think to my parents it's had a huge impact on them they are very supportive very caring I think it has given my mom a huge thing to worry about and my dad as well however my mum chose it more every time since the age of 11 till the age till now you know most times I leave the house I get asked whether I've got the right in slim and I've got snaps and lucozade I don't know it's just them looking after me and caring but sometimes it does it does become a bit repetitive but whilst I was at university I managed to lock myself out of my house without any insulin and because of that my blood Sugar's they skyrocketed I had to spend three days in hospital it was very apparent that the receptionist thought that I had just been drinking far too much last night and was very drunk even when we told her that I was a type 1 diabetic she still clearly thought that I was just really really drunk and had brought it upon myself and was very sharp and short not very caring and I think it was only when I managed to fill up a sick bowl incredibly quickly that she began to think there was actually something wrong with me so on the occasion that some ended up going to hospital he had to be told to go he didn't want to go he thought he had food poisoning or some sort of flu or bug and it was anyone I insisted that he went and I actually had to take him into a knee and even then when he was there I didn't feel he needed to be there until I was who the doctors explained the severity of the situation and actually congratulated me on taking him there so yeah he did need to be pressurised and I think it was a reality check for him that those things can happen in his life maybe he needs to take a bit more control so I'm now trying to tailor my insulin intake more to what I eat so I've now got an app on my iPhone that says exactly how much carbs are in each meal but obviously you then have to every meal gets it in front of you you have to taught it up and work out the right amounts of units of insulin so it almost makes every meal into a bit of a math problem they've come to Green Park in London to run the London 10k I'm raising money for diabetes to UK so when I woke up this morning had a nice slow release car breakfast to last me throughout the activity and also took a bit less insulin for it so I'm running a bit high so that I don't dip down whilst I'm on it also hopefully I should make it to the end without having a hypo okay so I've just finished the 10k took me just over an hour about 105 I think because of the amount of sugar use running 10k and because it's very hot today it's lost in sweat and things like that just having a sugary drink to repoint some of that my stomach doesn't really feel like I can take any food at the moment despite the fact that I've got diabetes it doesn't stop me doing these things just means that there needs to be a few more plans in place but you're still doing [Music]	High Medical Info

Your Body Mass Index Will Tell You	"Frank Melidona, DO of The Villages Health¬Æ, explains what Body Mass Index is, and how it plays a role in weight management. This video is just one of many that offers health and wellness tips at http://bit.ly/2j1jiqn

""When looking at body weight, we use a chart called a BMI or body mass index, which is a calculation of your height and weight. They put your height and weight into a formula and they spit out a specific number. This number can be found on a big table of numbers, and you can pick out your height and weight and go right across and find your BMI.

""There are different categories of BMI; healthy weight is a BMI of 19-25. A BMI of 26 to 30 is considered overweight. A BMI of 31 to 35 is the first part of obesity so we call it Obesity 1, 35 to 40 is Obesity 2, and when you hit 40 and above, we call it Morbid Obesity. That‚Äôs not a great term and we don‚Äôt want to use it to describe somebody, but it is what it is. If your BMI is over 40 you are way overweight; your risk of developing diseases like diabetes and cardiac diseases are much greater the higher your BMI.""

Patel where I answer your questions about medical marijuana and CBD oil alright so let's get on to today's question it comes from Samantha of Los Angeles California and here's what she writes dr. Patel I've had diabetes for a while now and because of it I'm experiencing some really horrid pain in my legs and feet the pain just creeped up on me out of nowhere at first I was having pain here and there and didn't really make much of it but now it's turned into a nuisance that won't leave me alone night everyday it's relentless during the day much of what I feel is numbness but during the course of the day the numbness turns into a feeling of pins and needles prickling my legs and feet then there are other times when I feel like my legs and feet are on fire the pain won't let me sleep either I wake up in the middle of the night with this feeling of electricity shooting down my legs it's painful to even have socks on it took a lot of trial and error to find a medication that helped I have to tell you that the process drove me nuts after trying oxycodone tramadol nortriptyline and lyrica we finally settled on gabapentin the gabapentin takes the edge off every once in a while it allows me to have a good day on these days I can remember what my life was like when I didn't have pain although I have to say that most days are bad days I'm still searching for a solution which can help me turn most of my bad days into good days I've been putting my life on hold because of this pain it gets in the way of doing the things that make me happy I just want to be able to play golf again have you found that CBD oil helps patients with neuropathy warm regards Samantha okay Samantha so in your particular case you know that your neuropathy is caused by diabetes but there a lot of other causes of neuropathy such as a nerve compression so sciatica for instance multiple sclerosis chemotherapy induced neuropathy surgical damage carpal tunnel syndrome Lyme disease complex regional pain syndrome which is abbreviated CRPS and poor circulation so these are some of the more common causes of neuropathy that I've treated and in addition I've also treated idiopathic neuropathy which is when the cause of the neuropathy is not known now CBD in general has helped my patients to relieve the pain that's associated with their neuropathy and this is whether the CBD comes from hemp or from marijuana so most usually when you hear the word CBD the CBD is generally derived from hemp now either way whether the CBD comes from marijuana or from hemp your body recognizes the CBD as the same and so with the hemp based CBD you don't actually have to worry about getting high because by law the amount of THC in hemp derived CBD products should be less than 0.3 percent and with marihuana based products you want to look closely at either the packaging or the laboratory test results to figure out how much more CBD there is relative to the amount of THC okay so let me dive into the research on CBD and neuropathy and then I'll go over the results that my own patients have experienced with the help of CBD okay so let's see here one group of researchers pull together data from five different studies on the impact of CBD on neuropathic pain and this was in 41 patients and they found that while on average placebo reduce their pain by point eight points CBD on average decrease their pain one point five points so uh so on average CBD was twice as effective as placebo it's important to note that in most of these studies the patients in the placebo group were allowed to receive rescue drugs for their pain and they were also allowed to increase the doses of their pain medications in addition the pain relief from CBD was retained over time and this was on average for at least the six to ten week follow-up period okay so what's going on why is it that that CBD is helping to relieve nerve pain okay so we have systems in our body that help to manage pain and they're called pain pathways so more specifically you can think of the whole system as an army and just like an army has a system of communication so does the nervous system okay so so you have some troops that have been specifically assigned the task of detecting pain once they detect pain they send off signals to the command center which is a brain the brain then decides how it wants to react whether it's physically and/or emotionally so then the brain sends commands to another set of troops who know how to carry out that specific command so let's take a look at an example of what happens when your right hand experiences a specific type of pain burning from a hot plate so when the detecting troops sense that your right hand is near something really really hot they're gonna send off signals to the command center of the brain the brain event is going to decide that it needs to move your hand away from the hot plate so it sends the command over to the Troops who know how to move your hand away from the hot plate all of this complex signaling happens within seconds which is pretty incredibly amazing now the a CBD in these pain pathways is that it weakens the signals being sent to the brain research and animals has shown that when there's a nerve injury the body produces even more receptors for cannabinoids along these pain pathways and cannabinoids are chemicals like CBD and THC now activating these receptors overall makes the detecting troops less likely to fire off signals to the brain okay now let's go over the results that I've seen in the patients that I've treated so chronic pain is one of the most common conditions that I've treated and then within the category of chronic pain I would say that neuropathy is one of the more common causes of chronic pain that I've treated so when it comes to chronic pain when it comes when it comes to neuropathy I've seen results very similar to those in patients that have pain in general so CBD oil helps to either dull or it could entirely eliminate pain the level of pain relief that the patient's experience depend a lot on where they start in terms of their level of pain so so those in severe pain report moderate levels of pain with the use of CBD oil those in moderate pain report mild levels of pain with the use of CBD oil and then finally those in mild levels of pain typically report and a complete elimination of pain with the use of CBD oil now also for my patients the use of CBD oil also affects the use of their pain medications so for some it helps to reduce the use of their prescription pain medications either they cut back on the dosages of the medications that they're on or they cut back on the number of different prescription medications that they're on and then in some case in and then in some cases patients are able to completely come off of their prescription pain medications and they're able to manage their pain just with the of CBD alone and then overall I'd say that the vast majority of my patients report that CBD oil works as well if not better than opioids but without the side effects okay so I hope that helps to answer your question Samantha now if you have questions about you know which brand of CBD oil to use how much to use when to use it etc then head on over to my website www.africanelements.org	High Medical Info

1 diabetes video for you if you are not subscribed to my channel definitely do so down below because i post a lot of type 1 diabetes videos on here including day in the life vlogs before i start this video i just want to say that i am not a medical professional so if you have any questions or concerns about your health definitely reach out to your own health care provider i wanted to make this video because now it is more important than ever to recognize the warning signs of type 1 diabetes due to the pandemic a lot of people are putting off going to see healthcare providers in fear of coming into contact with or even catching covid19 even though there is a risk associated with going out to seek medical attention it's really important that you don't ignore any symptoms that you're having if you think that there's something off with your body or there's something wrong it isn't worth the risk putting off going to see your doctor especially when it comes to something as serious as type 1 diabetes undiagnosed type 1 diabetes is very dangerous it can lead to a serious complication known as diabetic ketoacidosis also known as dka which is where your blood essentially turns acidic and this can lead to swelling in your brain and unfortunately can lead to death so needless to say it's really important to know these warning signs of type 1 diabetes and catch it early early detection of type 1 diabetes can also prevent unnecessary hospitalization which will prevent you from contracting kovid while in the hospital so it's even more important now to know the warning signs which is why i'm making this video before i start listing the warning signs i have got to stress that type 1 diabetes can happen anytime and by that i mean it does not matter how old you are i personally know a lot of people type 1 diabetes who are diagnosed as an adult in their 30s 40s 50s 60s there's a misconception out there that type 1 diabetes is only diagnosed in children and that's just simply not true so these warning signs that i'm about to go through in this video are for anyone okay warning sign number one excessive thirst i personally did not have this warning sign but my friends who did have it who are living with type 1 diabetes now described it as unquenchable thirst so you're thirsty you drink a big glass of water and you still feel thirsty after no matter how much you drink you just cannot quench your thirst which leads me to warning sign number two frequent urination so i mean those two kind of go hand in hand you're drinking a lot you're peeing a lot the kidneys are also working in overload too when your blood sugar is high some people even report bedwetting before being diagnosed with type 1 just because you have to pee so frequently that can't hold it in at night warning sign number three is unexplained weight loss and this i actually did have before i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes but it was subtle my family and i didn't really notice it and the fourth most common warning sign of type 1 diabetes would be exhaustion you don't have enough insulin in your body you're not using the food to create energy so you're going to be exhausted and tired all the time so if you're someone who normally has a lot of energy and now you find that you need naps to get through the day that could be a warning sign so those are the four most common early warning signs of type 1 diabetes now i just want to tell you guys about mine i'm not going to go through my full diagnosis story because it's rather long but if you want to see the whole thing i'm going to put it up here a link to that video so my first warning sign was oral thrush which is a fungal infection in your mouth and throat cool right tmi maybe but that was my first warning sign i got that about maybe a couple months before i was diagnosed and it kind of makes sense because if your blood sugar is running higher you're more prone to an infection like that and then the warning sign that made my mom take me into the doctor's office which i'm not even sure if this was a warning sign but i felt like i needed to pee a lot um i had the urge to urinate but then when i went to use the washroom i didn't have to that's one warning sign that i haven't heard other people really have but that is the warning sign that made me go into the doctor and eventually get my type 1 diabetes diagnosis so i had some uncommon symptoms but i just want to share them with you guys because those are some symptoms that you don't see as much or you don't hear about as much so now i want to hear from you guys if you have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes what were your symptoms leave them in the comments down below because it'd be great for someone who's concerned maybe to see what your symptoms were and hear from other people living with type 1 diabetes other than myself and that's it for this video if you are watching this from home and you seriously think you might have type 1 diabetes give your health care provider a phone call it's just a quick phone call to see whether or not you need to be tested and the test is so simple it's just a finger prick and it can save your life i am also going to be leaving a really great resource from beyond type 1 in the description box down below about the warning signs of type 1 diabetes beyond type 1 is an amazing organization that has so many great resources and information for you guys so definitely check that out if you're interested in learning more and that's it from me for today thank you guys so much for watching and i will see you in the next video bye	Low Medical Info

It was a shock, and hasn't been easy dealing with it. But, I'm trying to make the most of the diagnosis, stick to my diabetes diet plan and hope the rest of my pregnancy passes quickly. It will all be worth it in the end! 

And again, as I mention in the video, I am not a dietitian or any sort of medical professional. In this video I merely talk about my experience thus far with gestational diabetes. Please speak with your doctor or dietitian on following the right gestational diabetes plan for you!

About Me:
Hi, I'm Lindsey! I'm a Chicago area mom who kind of gave up on my appearance after giving birth in 2011. Not that appearance is everything, but makeup is something I used to really enjoy. 

Starting in 2015 I decided to make more time for my self and made it a goal to wear makeup more often. I want to try new products, learn new techniques and just have fun with makeup again. To keep my self accountable, I started my YT channel back up with focus on beauty videos- like hauls, reviews and challenges. 

So far it's been a lot of fun, and has helped me stick to my goal. I hope you'll subscribe to see what I have in store next!

i'm going to do a little bit of a pregnancy update though this one is going to be a little bit different than anyone i've ever done on my channel here i don't even have any notes or anything i'm just going to kind of talk off the cuff here a little bit uh but today is february 29th 2017 and i am currently 29 weeks and three days pregnant uh so if you follow me on instagram you might have a little bit of an idea of what's going on but if you don't um i will have my link listed down in the description box if you want to go ahead and follow me over there but if you have not followed me and you don't know what's going on this will be a little bit of news for you if you really care but last week when i was 28 weeks pregnant i was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and it has kind of been i don't know if i want to say like a whirlwind of a week uh but it has been an interesting week that's for sure uh and i'm not gonna lie uh it's kind of sucked and of course on top of the gestational diabetes i have been dealing with my hypertension issue since the beginning of my pregnancy i did have the hypertension issues of course when i was pregnant with my first child though i did pass the glucose tolerance test so i did not have gestational diabetes when i was pregnant with my son i did fail the one hour test with him but i passed the three hour test uh but this time around that was not the case uh last week when i was 28 weeks pregnant i went in for my glucose tolerance test which if you're not very familiar with what that is uh basically all you do is you go in and they draw some blood from you and then they give you this nasty nasty drink and i remember the drink being so much worse this time around than it was last time around i've switched providers so they could just have a different kind but this it was so sweet and so sugary and it was just like it's like a syrup basically that you drink so after they draw your blood they uh they give you this drink that you have to take and or that you have to drink within a few minutes and then you wait an hour and then they draw your blood again and based on the readings of what however they test your blood um the number that they're looking for is either 130 or 140 i think what i don't remember exactly what it is uh but apparently mine was 199 which is very very high so they called me with that news and of course i was like trying to hold back tears when they were telling me all this stuff on the phone it was so overwhelmed uh and so of course i was like can i take the three hour test you know can we see because they had basically just told me that i had gestational diabetes i was like can i take the three hour test like i had to do it with my son which is no fun you have to get poked so many more times you just have to waste you know four hours of your life basically sitting in a doctor's office but at that point of course i wanted to take the test and they said you're gonna fail it there's no way you could pass that with a number like 199. guess the three-hour test is you know just basically for for people that are kind of on the cusp of passing the the glucose tolerance test that didn't quite make it like that's what happened with me last time but they said there's no point you just have gestational diabetes you need to make an appointment with a nutritionist and hopefully you can keep it all diet controlled so that was gestational diabetes and i would imagine with any kind of diabetes speaking of which you know i've only been doing this for a week now but my heart goes out to anybody that has to deal with either type 1 or type 2 on a daily basis you know for years and years for their entire life this is no walk in the park it is just there's so much information that you have to remember so my heart really goes out to anybody that's been doing this for a really long time but basically with gestational diabetes the first line of defense is to change your diet so what's happening in your body with gestational diabetes and the problem from what i understand is the placenta it's not processing food properly for you or it's preventing you from processing food and specifically sugars properly so it's causing your blood sugar to go up and again from my understanding once you deliver the placenta after you give birth you don't have gestational diabetes anymore of course this could be an underlying problem that i didn't know that i had and i will have to continue to stay on this diet and possibly go on medication and then insulin or whatever hopefully that's not the case and everything will be fine and of course i think like six weeks after i uh give birth you know at my regular checkup i will probably have to do another kind of test to make sure that i don't have this um as an underlying problem but um so the first line of defense as i said is to of course change your diet and you really do have to watch your carbs and you can only eat a certain amount of carbs per meal um in the morning you can eat less at least this is what my nutritionist told me and again i am not a nutritionist i'm not a nurse i'm not any kind of medical professional so if you're looking at this video trying to get some tips and tricks and ideas maybe you were just diagnosed or something um talk to your doctor and your nutritionist for official instructions on how you should deal with it because i'm sure everyone is different so i'm just kind of giving some anecdotal advice here i guess or some anecdotal information about how i've been dealing with this but so for your carb intake you know it kind of varies per meal and per snack you don't have to be completely zero carb at least at this point i don't have to be but in the mornings i feel that it is a little bit trickier especially right after you wake up just because your body's been out of whack sleeping you know your whole sugar thing is kind of off and you're going from very low blood sugar in the morning because you haven't eaten anything for so long to eating you know usually you know if you eat a pancake or a toast or something your blood sugar will spike and mine especially because i have this gestational diabetes will spike very high very fast so i've had to be very cautious about what i eat and i've been trying to eat a lot of cheese and a lot of eggs in the morning and that seems to work really well for me fortunately i can drink my keurig coffee pods that i really like those are sweetened there's a little bit of sugar in there i think they have nine grams of carbs and i can do that and then something more protein based and my numbers have been okay um and then throughout the day as i go on i've noticed i have been able to eat a little bit more carbs each meal and my dietitian did set out you know a specific number of carbs that i should eat at each meal i've been realizing not all carbs are created equal and that's kind of hard because today my blood sugar actually spiked after lunch after eating some chips um and the number of carbs was within my guidelines but i'm thinking because the chips weren't whole grain they're not you know that healthy for you but i can't get away with eating as many of those as i could maybe like a whole grain sandwich or something even if it was the same amount of carbs and i've heard that from other people that i've had gestational diabetes and been reading online that that is kind of the case for a lot of people so you know it's really at this point because i'm still only a week into this as a little bit of trial and error and of course i'm trying to keep my blood sugars as low as possible you know between each meal i have not had hardly any uh any kind of treat like a sweet kind of thing at all the last week and that's really hard because if you've watched my other pregnancy vlogs this pregnancy you know that that's what i've been craving is sweet stuff all the time maybe that has something to do with why i got gestational diabetes this time i don't know i mean probably not because i wasn't like gorging on sweet stuff really but that's definitely what i've been craving and what i've been wanting to eat but i can't do that anymore and it's really really difficult so then now of course because i am a diabetic i do have one of these little things this is a glucose monitor i think is what they're called and i do have to check my blood uh four times a day which is not fun once right when i wake up in the morning and then after every meal and this is the actual thing that actually pokes my finger which is really not fun but i've gotten used to it and it doesn't hurt that much i'm just kind of the anticipation i've realized is what i really don't like i'm just kind of like as i'm holding this thing like right up there i'm like and then it's fine and it really doesn't hurt that much um and if you are just starting out in this journey whether it's you know type 1 type 2 or gestational diabetes i had absolutely no clue how to use this thing the first couple of days it was really really difficult so let me give you a couple of little pointers that my nutritionist or my dietitian gave me again i'm not a nutritionist dietitian any kind of medical professional but this is pretty good i think this is pretty good advice wash your hands of course before you lance your finger in warm water to kind of get the blood flowing and then what my dietitian told me is to massage your finger i'm not trying to flick you off this is just the finger that i usually uh lance massage your finger a little bit beforehand because before she told me any of this i was poking myself like five or six times just to get a tiny little drop of blood and i was wasting so many testing strips because i wasn't putting enough blood on them and it was just a mess it was horrible um but after she kind of helped me out i've only had to use one test strip per time that i do it which is good um and it doesn't hurt nearly as much because i've only had to poke myself once um so again after you or before you poke yourself go ahead and massage your finger a little bit then poke yourself you know you're supposed to poke yourself right here on the side of your finger and you could do any finger really and you could do any side and then my initial reaction was as soon as i poked myself was to just squeeze right where i poke and she said that you want to start from the base of your finger and massage up again and that'll really start to get the blood flowing even if it doesn't look like you poked yourself hard enough and there's no blood coming out initially start massaging yourself from down here and then it'll it'll come and you'll be able to kind of control how much blood you need to get out so you get the perfect amount so you're not gushing which definitely happened to me the first couple of days as well it's just it's been so much easier i'm so thankful that my doctor made me go see the dietitian specifically so i could learn how to use this thing because that's absolutely no clue um but so then of course if you cannot control your blood sugars through your diet like if even if you're eating like absolutely no carbs your sugars are still sky high you probably will be put on some kind of oral medication so that would be the next line of defense i'm hoping that i don't have to go there at all this pregnancy of course nobody wants to have any extra medication and i am on a hypertensive or on a hypertension medication already um but i think the one that i've read about the most is called metaformin i could be wrong but that seems to be the pregnancy safe one and then if that's not enough then you will have to go on insulin shots which scare me to death i do not want to go on insulin i cannot imagine having to give myself a shot every single day or however many times a day you would have to give yourself that insulin i'm honestly not sure how it works and hopefully i won't ever have to find out how it works um you know this thing is hard enough for me to do like actually putting like a bigger needle in there and you know ah gosh that just sounds horrible to me but of course if that's what it comes to then then we will do it um and then as far as when i'm going to give birth who knows i mean really it's still up in the air i've not seen my doctor since i've been diagnosed so hopefully by the next appointment i'll get a whole lot more information with my son i did give birth to him at 36 weeks because of my hypertension which has been okay uh so far but because i also have the gestational diabetes this time around i'm thinking um even if i do go past 36 weeks that i probably they will not let me go past 38 if i managed to make it that far on my own um so i'm thinking at this point i have less than 10 weeks left which i'm really hoping because this just has not been a walk in the park for me i'm also seeing a physical therapist for my uh back issues so i have a lot to deal with right now and of course i'm so thankful that i was able to get pregnant very easily and that i've got this wonderful new life inside of me but i'm just really ready to be done i've got to be honest like i mentioned earlier the problem most likely lies within the placenta and once i pass the placenta then i won't have gestational diabetes anymore but when my daughter is born they will be checking her and they will have to poke her quite a few times from what i understand in the first 24-48 hours however long um just to make sure that her blood sugars are okay to make sure that she's um that they're not too high or too low or you know however wonky they might be i'm not quite sure um which sucks i'm not looking forward to her having to go through that but she'll be one day old two days old she's not gonna remember it um and of course it's for her health and safety uh so that she can you know get the best care that she needs but i know that's going to be hard for me to see or in here because i'm sure she's going to scream and cry but i'd rather her have to go through that and rather than have some kind of problem not be diagnosed oh and then also if you have just been diagnosed with gestational diabetes you will start getting more ultrasounds because i do have the hypertension problem i've been getting extra ultrasound since i was 20 weeks like i had my regular 20 week one and then i had 24 and 28 and then my next one will be i think at 32 and then 36 if i make it that far um then that was all just scheduled because of my hypertension but now we're looking for signs of problems with the diabetes and it's kind of funny because hypertension can make babies too small and they kind of can restrict growth and gestational diabetes can make them too big so i'm kind of hoping that you know there's a happy medium in there for for my baby but by based on the last ultrasound that we had just a few days ago she's measuring quite large uh she was i think at 28 weeks and six days she was already about three and a half pounds and of course those i don't think are ever very accurate but that just sounds huge and based on what i've read for a 20 weight for a 28 week baby they should be measuring about two and a half to two and three quarter pounds so she's already quite large hopefully you know now that i have everything under control her growth is not going to be huge and by the next time i go in uh in like three weeks for my next ultrasound she will have slowed down a little bit so she's not quite so far ahead in her growth um because that can be a little bit dangerous too and of course that could prevent me from having a vaginal delivery and you know can increase the the need for a c-section just because uh the babies are too big you know especially the the further along you get in your pregnancy and then just one last thing that i wanted to touch on even though presuming that as soon as i deliver the placenta i don't have gestational diabetes anymore i am for the rest of my life much more high risk for developing type 2 diabetes as well as my daughter is which i have a really really hard time um dealing with that and that i think has made me the most upset over anything i mean the diet sucks you know because i can't have just whenever i can't eat whenever i want i have to stick on a you know tight schedule and eat only specific foods and stuff but because she's already starting out her life with a higher risk of something that she has nothing to do with that's really really what what has caused me to be the most upset over having this but there's nothing i can do and of course you can decrease your risk of getting type 2 diabetes by having a good diet and exercising and all that kind of stuff so hopefully um you know i can instill and heard that uh you know that that's the way to live your life is to have a healthy life uh with good food and exercise and stuff but um i just feel terrible i'm not gonna lie um there's really no way around it uh you know i'm i'm giving her a higher risk of developing a horrible disease um and and i i just you know hope every single day that she doesn't ever get this and of course i i don't want to develop it later in life as well then going forward like i said at six weeks or so i will have to retest and then i guess every couple years i'm going to need to retest as well i'm not sure if my daughter will need to retest or test herself or if there's ever going to be a need for her to test before she ever you know has babies or anything i don't know about that but my nutritionist said every couple years i'm assuming just with my general practitioner i will need to probably just take retake the glucose tolerance test which kind of sucks but again you know it's better to know and take that test and be bored for an hour in a waiting room and you know then start to live you know within the parameters of gestational or of type 2 diabetes then go undiagnosed because i know it can cause a lot of problems later in life if you don't have it diagnosed so i know this was kind of a weird kind of video for me but i really just wanted to talk about this because it's very scary and if again if you're somebody that's just found this video of mine because you've been diagnosed with gestational diabetes or you're thinking that maybe you're going to be diagnosed um it's manageable at least for me at this point it is manageable with my diet and it sucks and it's not fun but it could be worse you know when i first started doing some research i thought i was going to be able to eat like absolutely no carbs at all and the other day we went to steak and shake and i got a double cheeseburger i ate both the buns and i was fine i didn't have any of the fries i did have a salad with it but that was within my parameters so i actually did the same thing with wendy's the other night as well like i had a double cheeseburger and a salad and my body didn't like wendy's i was okay at steak and shake but i was a little bit high with wendy's so you do kind of have to watch where you go and stuff but um it's manageable it is um and if you guys have any questions feel free to leave them in the comments below or if you have any advice for anybody else you know feel free to leave those in the comments below as well i would love it if you would subscribe to my channel i do lots of different beauty kind of videos and i've been doing some more regular kind of uh pregnancy updates on my channel as well and i post bump pictures over on my instagram every wednesday so i will have that linked down below and you can go check that out if you'd like but yeah thank you so much for watching this video if you are just newly diagnosed with gestational diabetes try not to beat yourself up over it i know it's really really hard i know i have done my fair share over the last week but it's really nothing that you have done or that i have done and it just sucks that we now have to deal with this really for the rest of our lives because we're dealing with this now during our pregnancies but it is what it is we'll all get through it um and i just wish you all the best of luck if it's something that you're dealing with and know that you're not alone but thank you again so much for watching and i will see you in my next video bye	Low Medical Info

four years old but little Luther who's just under two in this photo is taken and I don't know how I can I don't know how we can change it but Luther always seems to have this pose in the photos he always looks a little bit gormless I think that's what he takes after me this was taken about September last year it was a Thursday evening and we were just myself and my family were getting ready to go over to our local supermarket to do the family shop we do it every week on a Thursday evening and I always dread it I spend my week building up to that time I know as soon as I get in the car we're driving down the road we only live about a mile away from the supermarket but we drive there because we carry shopping anymore we pull into the car park and all of a sudden I know is gonna be car park warfare you must have been there you must know what I'm talking about you pull into the car park and your wife or partner who is driving the car has this compulsion to get the closest possible parking space to the front door of the shop if you've got kids in the car as well it gets even worse because then you've got the parent or child spots and if somebody pulls into a parent and child spot without children in their car oh my god so we usually have this little battle to and fro I like to park as far away from the shop as possible because I know I can get a car parking space whereas my wife will have a ten minute round trip of going around the car luck I want you to consider the thought process here what we're doing by within that small kind of example of life and day to day life is minimizing the physical activity that we have to deal with where I'm thinking from is that I'm happy to walk that extra hundred meters to the shop I'm happy to try and carry the shopping all the way back to the car we've to screaming kids and I think the modern persona is to try and minimize as much physical activity from day-to-day life as we can the idea of progress in the modern day often involves regressive physical activity and I wanted to bring up that idea for you guys today is something to consider and offer a few kind of ideas around how we can avoid this problem of lack of physical activity in day to day life but I want to take just a moment to think about it in the context of evolution of our species our species and we us as people evolved to what we'd recognize as people about 70,000 years ago we've got similar mentality similar physicality as those people in that time frame yeah at that time we were hung together as we were nomadic and physical activity in day to day life was inherent it was in everything we had to do and we couldn't get away from it if we wanted to live yeah about 15,000 years ago we decided right we're going to stay put where we are and we're going to start growing our food in the in the field all rearing around the malls for food and our physical activity diminished a little bit but we were still really heavily active trying to having to deliver or having to feed ourselves having to take advantage of the things that are around us bring it forward another step to our kind of grandparents even an arrow and we could go and buy a shop in maybe a little bit before that as well but they'd have to walk to the shops now we drive and actually the way that my wife and I have solved the problem of carpark warfare is we just order online so we've taken that next step on from having so much physical activity in our day-to-day life to sitting on the sofa and just ordering our food online what I want to kind of talk around today is how physical activity because of that removal from day to day life has become really a formal process nowadays we don't get physical physically active in our day to day life we have to take certain chunks of time out of our week to go and be physically active we have to go to the gym or we have to go and exercise although exercising is what we do in every day every second moving around and I think the idea now of exercise is going and spending time on that hamster wheel at the gym or sitting down on the bike in the gym and just watching TV and that's how I exercise and I think I want to kind of deviate away from that and I wanted to ask you or start to think about how can we reinsulate physical activity into our day to day life to save ourselves from the problems their lack of physical activity bills as a species really we've kind of climbed up a mountain in terms of progress from 70,000 years ago to now there's a huge change in terms of the way that we operate in a day to day life particularly in the last 20 years since we've invented since we've the dot-com boom and the time where we've been able to do all everything we need to do online without activity we've kind of stepped up to the edge of that cliff on our Mountain and we're kind of deciding whether we want to jump off at the moment really we're living longer all of the statistics currently throughout UK throughout the world demonstrate that we're living a longer life but really what does that life look like we're living a longer life but we're spending more time in active and we're spending more time frail at the end of our life trying to struggle on that and what I want to try and promote you guys is the idea of being physically active to extend the quality of your life just a couple of Statistics off of the the World Health Organization I don't want to make this to talk about body weight and obesity because everybody gets that ram down their throat all the time and I think we're really desensitized to it nowadays but it is a big problem just in that last kind of generation or to a lot of our lifespan the world population has gone from kind of 20% of people being overweight right up to 40% of people being overweight in this world that's including everybody if we just look at the economically developed countries we're looking at closer to 70% of people in the modern day as being classified as medically overweight now the reason I wanted to bring that up is because of the perception of that cause is so because the majority of our environment is surrounded by people who are overweight I'm overweight and we in terms of a medical point of view see everything in that way all the time it becomes our normal and really it's not normal really we should be what operate in 10 or 15 or 20 or 30 years ago in terms of because of the physical activity and I think that perception this guided by our environment is a really important for process to have because that's how our body operates like we were talking about with like Joel mentioned earlier on when we were in our comfort zone we stay we stay comfortable our body stays on a flat line and then really what we're like is a roll in stone if our level of activity in our environment drops down our body follows it down like a rolling stone if our body you're our level of physical activity increases in our environment our body drives itself up the hill is tough work but we become more physically able and I think it's those challenges of physical ability that are really important to try and have in all want to tell you guys is that your bodies are amazing not just your bodies in general you specifically your body is fantastic it's made up of a number of different complex systems so complex that we haven't ever seen anything even close to the same complexity level as your own body that you own I just want you to take a minute to think about that everything in your entire life the entire internet the entire universe nothing compares to the complexity that you own right underneath your clothes it's like a computer we put stuff in and we get an output back out in general the only difference is that this computer is able to adapt to its day-to-day environment and life now once we in once we invent a computer that can do that then maybe we're we're in trouble but at the moment we're doing really well the point is it's generally predictable so I want to ask everybody how many of you deal with day to day aches and pains or niggles that lower back pain raise your hand those sore knees yeah it's a really common problem and from my position as a sports scientist strength and conditioning coach working with athletes and the general public the public there's absolutely no reason why anybody should have to deal with ongoing aches and pains and niggles unless there's a chronic underpinning there's always a reason why and we always we can always find it way that the body adapts it follows a natural curve if you and this will be intuitive to you guys it's called super compensation theory but this will be intuitive and you'll all know that this happens within your body you start on that straight line where your body likes to be that position where it doesn't change and you do some exercise or you do some physical activity and all of them what and you feel fatigued you feel tired and your energy levels and output go down then your body starts to adapt you realize is that this stimulus from its environment is attacked it and it starts to change and become better so that that doesn't happen in the future we improve and we get above our line what we want to try and do is make the physical stimulus of activity happen when we're above that line so the frequency that we're working at in terms of our physical activity is always at that point where our body's just a little bit better and then once we do that again and again and again we get a little bit better again and again and again and it only has to be a small amount but doing it works in the reverse if we do a small amount of things really badly again and again and again and again it's that downward spiral it's like a big hole this crater in South China was created through the frequent low intensity activity of water now it's 120 million cubic meters while that the volume of that is 120 million cubic meters that's a massive number it was too big for me so I had to put it into context for me now I know there's a lot of students in the room so I convert in converted it into alcohol consumption for you guys and if we filled this entire crater with booze it would be enough to fulfill the world's usage of alcohol for seven and a half years and that was created by the steady slow repetitive low intensity forces of water and what I want to try and give you guys is the idea that we can do that in our own lives with our own physicality with the slow steady frequent stimulus of small amounts of physical activity the current stimulus we deal with is sitting in a car or sitting at our desk doing work or sitting at home or playing on our phone positions that are all closing us down and returning us into that fetal position that we started life in strengthening the muscles down the front of our body and maybe neglecting the muscles down the back of our body what if we flip this on its head what happens if we do do that a little bit of physical activity every day that just helps build towards a more consistent physically able life we earned ourselves a better quality of life for longer we can control the way our body and have a more deep meaningful relationship with our body understand how it works it gives us a better chance to remain disease-free for longer in our life in the modern day the knowledge is everywhere the most of the knowledge that I draw on in my in my professional work is 50 or 60 years old the fundamental basic simple things that's different to the way that fitness is marketed nowadays it's always secrets provided by gurus and really the information is everywhere now I just want to end the talk with a little bit of a physical example for you guys because I'm a sports person I couldn't get away with not getting you guys active so what I'd like to do is just show you the difference and show you the kinds of positions that would be facing so if everybody stands up all I'd like you to do is try and touch your knees six times but I want you to look at everybody else in the room as they do it and remember the body positions that you're seeing so nice and quick just touch your knees six times look around see what kind of body positions RCM so hopefully we're starting to recognize one of my major coaching rules is if it looks pretty it's probably right if it looks like a car crash it's probably a car crash what we're starting to see there is a lot of reliance on that frontal musculature that arch back in that strain which is where that those aches and pains come from if we can keep those positions straight and strong the pain goes away and we're able to control it now what I'd like you to do is I'm gonna show you what it feels like for those back muscles to feel like they're working I'd like you to sit back down in your chair but first I want you to raise your hands up sorry if I on top here raise your hands up over your head as high as you can they have to stay behind your head and then sit back down on that chair keeping your hands back now hopefully everybody felt those muscles in there throughout their back working hard to try and stabilize their posture we think about these issues as social problems they are social problems but only because we as individuals don't take responsibility for our own situation that should be really promising for you guys because it means that you have full control and it's not a social issue is something that you can manage I want to encourage you to take the first step today literally and take control of your body your health and your life thank you [Applause] [Music]	Low Medical Info

00:50 ‚Äì Rose ‚Äì I just flew overseas to try to help my uncle, who 2 weeks ago had a stroke. In addition to his lymph cancer that has spread to his liver and heart. He had chemo and another session of some sort and 2 days later had a stroke‚Ä¶

34:23 ‚Äì Bethany - Should I take your Healthy Pituitary Capsules or your Female Reproductive Tonic capsules? I'm a 29 year old with hyperandrogenism, hormonal acne, and lipomas (one under my left armpit). I have irregular cycles, and I track my temperature each morning. Chicken and sugars have been the main culprits in causing ovulation problems. I've tried being a raw vegan but I am also having troubles with my insulin, so dates/fruits can be a problem. I would like to have kids in around 3 years.

40:43 ‚Äì Kara - You are lovely. A true healer! I've encountered so many spiritual awakening since fruit and herbs, some frightening most wonderful. was wondering what you're perspective on hybrid fruits and herbs are wouldn't they be acid forming if they man made? according to Dr. Sebi, do you know his teachings? Also thoughts on Irish Sea moss have you tryed it before? Ancient civilizations with more advanced technology producing free energy?

50:37 ‚Äì Jill - I came across a video on YouTube by a chiropractor named Eric Berg who describes why most peoples' bodies are too ALKALINE, and that they need to take apple cider vinegar in order to acidify themselves. He says being too alkaline, especially as we age, results in inability to absorb calcium... This is obviously the opposite of what Dr. Morse teaches, I would like to hear him comment on it.

58:52 ‚Äì Tom ‚Äì I am from Holland and very curious and health. The last few months I‚Äôve been studying your videos and book, I‚Äôm very interested in your theory of human health, combine with herbal medicine‚Ä¶

1:03:41 ‚Äì Debra - My health has been up and down for many years. ¬†in 2014 i had Breast Cancer and while in the hospital they did a cardiac catheterization. I soon had a device inserted for radiation over the course of a week... called a Savvi Catheter.¬† Only had a small cancer stage 1. But I am on a cancer drug 'anastrozole' , for 2 years now and have to take it for another three‚Ä¶

01:20:31 ‚Äì SQ - I pray God will bless you with a long life! We need you to show us the way back to health. My mother, 70.5 years old, has a very severe case of spinal stenosis along with adrenal adenomas and cysts on her kidney. She has been on the kidney caps & drops + lymph + adrenal/endocrine (I switch between the two) & stomach caps for almost a year. No improvement. I‚Äôve recently added the Pain + Spasm drops. Some improvement but not consistently. She is 98% fruit. She has much stress. I‚Äôm unable to take good quality photos of the eyes. I am taking your course but not learning fast enough to help her. It‚Äôs painful to watch her suffer. ¬†What am I missing? She is in a toxic relationship that has her constantly scared and ¬†¬†stressed. Working on a way out. In the meantime is there a way to reverse her conditions? Thank you for sharing your wisdom with us.

01:32:24 ‚Äì Dayne - I'm a 24 year old male with extreme depression and anxiety. I'm on the Ssri Celexa 10 mg currently. I was at 40 mg, but slowly reducing my dose because if the side affects. I been watching your videos for a while now and recennly ordered the fab 4 kit to help move lymph. I'm trying hard to stop eating meat because of the high acidosis, but when I only eat fruit.. I'm always hungery a couple of hours later. Is something else wrong?

1:39:03 ‚Äì Ashley - Hello my name is Ashley and I'm seventeen years old and ever since last year in the early spring I've been experiencing terrible dyshidrosis. At first it started off small and I thought it would go away but then the fluid filled blisters increased on my pointer finger on my right hand then they spread to my middle and ring finger then to the pointer finger on my left hand. I think the cause may be stress due to all of the academics I undertake and the sleep deprivation I endure throughout the school year‚Ä¶"	169000.0	PT1H53M48S	2d	hd	False		0.0			11280.0	311.0	0.0	56.0	2011-03-29T15:20:59Z	robertmorsend	13891912.0	good morning good morning good morning it is morning mom no it's good good lunch good lunch good lunch but we got a tropical storm out there and the energy is do it baby see here a couple of things let me see how's everybody good I hope got to be good no matter what the body is doing we got to be good this is a young lady I met at the class I remember you Rose freeman Rose a nurse maybe I can't remember what it was I think you were anyway she wrote me that says I just flew today overseas to try to help my uncle who two weeks ago had a stroke in addition to his limp limp cancer that had spread to his liver and his heart he had chemo and another session of some sort and two days later had a stroke no kidding I'm amazed that at these chronic levels that chemo doesn't cause more heart attacks and strokes I'm amazed when you look at heart attacks and a stroke which side of chemistry do you think they come from base or acid the only other two sides and you can actually ask that question of anything and everything you want to know about health is it acid forming or is it base forming because the body is the base forming dominant and that's the food for most vertebrates we talked about this before is base dominant foods which has an Oakland ash residue all right those are the foods that keep the anymore hydrated and alkalized in the blood perfect intellect beautiful stuff doesn't hurt at that raw and alcala and energized but when you go to the acid side which of course that's what the lymph system deals with us at acid side of chemistry check so then you can see that when that side of chemistry is backed up that the body gets into acidosis check and that acidosis then is met by an immune response called inflammation check and that inflammation has calcium buffering systems linked to it cholesterol buffering systems in but to not just interleukins and the like acento law implementing you could call say edema is involved in the inflammatory process oh yeah when you start dehydrating under the action sky you're going to be pulling osmotically water into these areas to try and remember what water is the universal solvent water is the universal solvent so this is well you see that edema crease when the body's acidic then it would be classic and - tied to what the kidneys and adrenal glands when the kidneys and adrenal glands going down you start to swell particularly the feet right well that should be classic in autopathic understanding no old it looks like they're getting away further and further down the road away from any siblings of truth there is so but all of these things you see man's going through is just simply a reflex or a response of the acid side of chemistry that we've created by eating acid ash dominating or forming foods and it's just what would happen to change you know and deal with that sort of thing so when you give a stronger acid by far a stronger acid you know the attributes that are damaging the cells that we talked about this many times the pH of the acid that are damaged in the cell is the same acid when you're drinking the coke when you're drinking a coca-cola or Pepsi or Dr Pepper or whatever it is you know how the burn is so strong that's 3ph well that's the same phosphoric acids carbonic acid all these acids are the same PHS and so cellular acids or metabolic acids are around 3 pH that's why there's bacteria in one's lymph nodes because bacteria in one's lymph nodes is responsible for taking that 3 ph acid and bringing it up or down however you wish to look at that - 6 or 6 something so you're not on your knees when you're peeing and you're not destroying urinary tract tissue and and and the like asses destroy their corrosive any chemistry book will tell you acids are corrosive so when the kidneys fail to eliminate these acids of course about yep those of you that have been on antibiotics with the medical insanity about the use of antibiotics going after bacteria instead of the real cause of things killing systemic bacteria so when you kill the bacteria in your lymph nodes imagine that now you have three ph acids coming out from the cells they're coming to the lymph nodes through the lymphatic both coming to the lymph nodes to be enacted upon by by a bacterium not macrophages they deal with damage cells so you have two things going on in a lymph node basically you have macrophages in other words you have those little not only carnivores but what is it when you eat your same species you know really you know they basically basically psycho Tiny's or breakdown themselves so you've got those and then you've got the bacteria so imagine killing the bacteria in your and your body and this is where you get into the Lupus the limes the the arthritis is you've been on antibiotics and what happens is now you have chronic pain because these acids now because of all the acidosis the kidneys fail the system fails agar malaysian takes place things become stagnant acids continue to compile in the body swelling then exists calcium is pulled to try to fight this and you get hardening of tissues and stuff like that calcifications and bone spurs and all those sort of things edema kept in you get water cholesterol sets in and you got lipid blocking all of this is just simply a response to acidosis because without an alkaline response to acidosis the deterioration of the body would be unbelievable unbelievable and fast no one would probably see past the age of five I mean it's just that bad so these two sides of chemistry like like all say all both sides of God have to be kept in checking and balance and so that's why you guys are here with all the beautiful love and understanding and godliness into this dark world of hate and anger and fear you guys are coming in with the answers you're learning and opening up and understanding the answers to these things and it's making this world open up it's forcing this world to the negative forces to recede we're more powerful truth is more powerful always but so those of you that antibiotics you're just walking up to the door of even more pain more pain because bacterium helps to get rid of those acids that cause you pain so it's just those things it's a horrible thing to see going on because a lack of understanding of the lymphatic system and acidosis so this year this man this uncle of rose here was given chemo for his lymph cancer which that's all cancer is has deterioration of a cell that's all it is and of course what what kind of chemistry is responsible to deterioration of cells acids okay then that's an answer to lymphoma but if it's a lymphoma and they keep following the lymphatic system into player then why don't they understand it more you don't have to have someone write a book on the lymphatic system to understand the lymphatic system particularly relationship to kidneys adrenals and skin you don't need that we've supplied that prior to this prior to his chemo he has been Everson trying with vegan at this point he is with well you you take someone that's highly acidic to the point where cells are being burnt or broken down it becomes an intracellular acidosis now because there is no more able to remove waste the catalytic waste external to a cell so it's backing up within the cell itself breaking its organelles down so it's just that sort of thing and then when you add a chemical to the body that is 10 to 50 times hotter than the acid that's already breaking the cells down what would you expect to get from that knowing all of that what would you expect to get by taking chemo well healthy winning the game over acidosis by taking a hotter attic not at all and the sad thing is medical doctors prey on the ignorance of people they don't want to talk to you guys because you're too smart they don't want to do just the little things you want to do in surgery and things like that surgeons are hurting themselves they need to distance themselves from the rest of the pack and be the fine surgeons they are if you're not a good surgeon be one or get out of the field a lot of people are getting butchered out there by lousy surgeons I mean look at the wonder what to call botched and just in plastic surgery alone look what you see real some of these surgeons so it's like it's in every field and I'll say this to you and in the young guys and gals be the best you could be I bet you heard that somewhere but always be the best you can be in whatever it is you're doing if you if you do this say you want to be a carpenter you do the very best and none of the best you can and be the best you can until you don't want to do it anymore you can go somewhere else and you're going to be a health counselor know the very best did very best at the questions until there is no no other question you can ask that's why why why why until there is no more place to go with it be always the best you can be then go on because that only serves you and the all of life because you're bumping with all of life always always and you come from the one right we all come from the one the infinite that which is all I was going to talk to you spiritually about that but maybe that'll come up later but at this point he is weak and frail bed-bound thank God he can't speak but very weak like see they just killin it they're just killing him and we allow that we should back in our family members don't let them kill them in a way when they say hey you don't know what you're talking about they're basically saying let them kill them because if you don't get the fact that most people don't survive chemo and radiation that they're on their deathbed and they're not going to pull out of it by some magic wand of God then you've got to be saying maybe there's something else we can try no I mean there's people that don't even want to do that and the death is covered it's like excuse me you have faith in what and all about the community doesn't even understand what the problem is yeah I mean this is a sick time in a world sick with souls that are unawakened be nice he wants to live is in excruciating pain the family refuses to remove two medicines from his daily intake one is a blood thinner with a fear of another stroke well I get that and and another is called whatever thank God I was able to convince him to take him off Morphin well that's for sure you want to give him some pain relief even if you could go down to say like an oxycodone say 350 milligrams or no st. no I do 350 milligrams or 325 milligrams of say acetaminophen with maybe 25 to 20 milligrams of that one in other words there's a way to get good pain control way down on the opioid scale the narcotic scale there is instead of going to morphine sulfate that one pretty much as the I'm happy and going out this way type of thing so but when you're in pain which side of chemistry are you on you're on the asset side right but they just gave him chemo which has at least a ph of hydrochloric acid if not hotter most chemo is generally hotter than hydrochloric acid so you're giving an acid that chews up meat and what do you call cells you know when I was in I had to go nursing and take IV therapy and some things like that when I was at my time at the hospital in nuclear medicine and the like and so when I was in I had to go to boat tech over here has a nursing program and I was taking a course on IV therapy and when they come to chemotherapy they were talking about the gloves and how you had to be very careful not to spill chemo on the patient's skin so below me and the nurse practitioner was an educator their professor there she goes yeah and I said why not she saw oh well it'll burn a hole in the skin I said well what's your skin made of anyway and then about then she knew I'm coming she said well of course cells of course I said but you want to introduce the same flood the same acidic blood intravenously and what your vascular walls made up of well she got the gift she didn't like me very well cells she said I said is that why you see the collapse of the brachial and all these arteries so they don't do that anymore do they they don't come in here very often anymore right because why because you lose the arteries why it sucks the calcium right out of the wall and they collapse you lose the connective tissue what is calcium calcium buffering system universities have proved this for years medical doctors not you're not you're bicarbonate system there's a bigger buffering system out there called a calcium buffering system a cholesterol buffering system thank you very much understand the lymphatic system so you can see why they destroyed so you're consuming a flood that destroys tissue for what reason is it now I forgot what reason it is is they gave this old man chemo what was it for now they destroyed tissue that is a crime in any book I give you something to destroy tissue basically I'm creating manslaughter or actually more because I'm determining I'm going to kill you this is a very serious serious crime around the world is taking place and they don't care they live under the narcissistic sky that well they survive lucky chap you know so when we get someone like that that wants to restore their health we educate them on the fact there is no such thing as diseases that's totally bull hockey that is something medical doctors made up because they don't understand health and you have to anyone that's dying like this has to turn away immediately away from anything pharmaceutical unless it's supporting their life now the blood thinners like coumadin and things like this dangerous stuff but then having a stroke is dangerous stuff how do you thin and I hate to use the word thin because that's a wrong statement in looking at all let's look at blood by Casa T fin & v let's use their thinking and their this organic chemistry when you acidify anything what is one of the side effects of that fluid or whatever you could be just boiling it it's a combination I said create a globule a ssin that is when you're cooking or whatever you're eliminating you are making everything break apart and restructure remag 'no ties again rebound again not the same electrical food it was everything rebounds and finally in the last few years they were able to admit that pasteurized milk doesn't give you calcium it actually can deplete calcium out of your body does anybody want to know why that is but they were going to tell anybody Cecil you have to understand anything that has an acid ash to it can it act the calcium buffer system in other words the body is going to steal calcium out of the connective tissue or skeletal tissue to try to stop this acidosis because acids chew up what tissue cells that's why there's so much pain and why people break down and they look so emaciated because acids destroy you and yet we have a huge modality trying to convince people this is the only way they know is to pour this hotter acid into the body or burn it out with radiation that's not even logical it exceeds any bounds of Lodge activity of any anything you could even comprehensive electrical since it doesn't make sense in any of the sciences that's going on here in all a bath you thinking and yet everybody thinks the science if people donate no and millions to these people and nothing has changed under the sky for how long yeah just more bad meds after more bad meds after more bad meds more fatal events more fatal events that's just a nightmare nightmare so you must understand as a person that life is almost over physically what you're up against and you're up against the system you're doing up against the disease anymore you're not up against anything that's bullcrap you're up against the largest system and your human body that's flood based that deals with acids and that itself has become so acidic that stagnation of this system is existed so imagine stagnation of your sewer system in your house but it can smell everywhere because it runs through every room you know every cell has sewage fluids running around it interstitially that is the dominant food interstitially interstitially means around your cells and every cell stands by itself with interstitial spaces around it how do we get to them how do we feed a cell okay and you've got blood or lymph interstitially remember interstitial fluid is 75 to 80% live why would the the very flood that gets around a cell to protection oh I said protect didn't I oh that's not the blood oh wait a minute blood doesn't protect the cell it does in one way it's alkalinity but the main protector of the cell is the lymphatic system you've then gone right the body is a food processor just like a car it's an energy process a carbon processor and the residues coming out is acidic and you have to have protection against these acids and when you lose that protection that's what everybody's seeing the acid blowback how deep does it go acute subacute chronic and degenerative take your pick where are you on that scale all we're seeing and there's different names of diseases and for different location on all four stages and learning those is not difficult and then you're way ahead if I'm this uncle I have immediately going on a great diet I'm going to find those those organic seedless concord grapes I'm going to be looking all over the world I'm going to be looking for the best food on the planet I'm going to look for mangoes this is a perfect mango season and mine's about ready you're going to see them coming and then you must be late this year that's good too in a way because I'm getting everybody else's mangoes but then Mike's coming in so it's like oh but that's that's the first thing I'm 100 percent fruits berries and melons and that's it period end of story uncle might go through some healing crisis some radical stuff but he's this guy they're going to deplete him down to nothing you know when you're older I take it he's over because I kind of know your age so I would say you probably not really old but you know what they'll just deplete him and deeply the depleting masters deplete you and deplete you and chew on you and break you down how does he how is he going to come out of that C&S he interjects for some of the interjectional coming out because they don't know how to pull someone out of this the medical doctors do not know how to pull anybody out of any of these states the little own chronic and degenerative generative that's like well they don't understand what causes these four stages in the first place so this is a people have to know wake up and understand these things and then they got the aha moment now I know why I and everybody else is suffering might not like the answer always because it comes back to you and what you're eating the chemistry you're interfacing with whether it's working eating playing whatever chemistry's chemistry if you interface with foreign chemistry and that includes most of the food that people eat to take the acid ash foods which is foreign chemistry to the human body you're going to get a blowback it is time to blow back is not fun pull a pain acid and the only way to get you out of pain is to suppress the nervous system the problem with suppressing the nervous system is it's needed in all chemical reactions your uncle needs service system more now than anything and they're destroying that so it's a mess it's a big mess and your uncle's got to pull himself out of that now what's a perfect blood thinner perfect I'll just use the word thinner but that's not appropriate name for this the proper pH of the blood you move that blood pH just a fraction and blood cells start sticking and you some of you have had that life blood cell analysis where you see your your red blood cells following each other like choo-choo train sticking to each other or worse yet clustering yeah no but that is from an acid ash forming diet in an in somatic low diet you put enzymes in a body from life and it'll start breaking these things apart so when you consume which food would be the most powerful food in correcting blood by Casa D and pH with it without any harmful side effects whatsoever like in rat I mean coumadin fruits berries and melons far better than vegetables farber matter of fact what's the vibe in case care the P you know that kind of stuff fruits berries and melons are the best for blood velocity and pH there is because they match in most cases the blood pH and viscosity absolutely excellent food source they are the human food source whether one likes it or not so you got your life to that you know but on this uncle I'm going to mediate on fruits berries and melons I'm going to try to get this chemo out of me as fast as I can I'm going to get these kidneys to filter I'm going to drive past 24 hours 36 hours I need my kidneys filtering yesterday because I've got liver involvement where else you got lifted vomit it put it that way it doesn't matter what organs are being chewed on because it's systemic that's what that gets meat about them your cancers moved on you oh really like it I'm a cancer I'm a disease I'm awake I'm my own consciousness and I'm in they're going to get you Oh me man has to wake up to the I mean they talked to people like their one-year-old and even though one-year-old would be insulted sometimes because you got these gigantic beings in little bodies it's a second cigarette I've seen that lady smoke within pepper thank God I was able to okay meanwhile I have been giving him juice great excellent since he can't eat oh yeah let's just destroy the body until they can't even friggin eat anymore you know what I love it now the stroke all right so stroke where you going first of all where we going to do with this guy first of all the problem is we've got a lymphoma going on but we also have poor circulation going on so we have a little one in my opinion because since tumors are generally interstitial fluid then there is blood and bile so when I increase blood flow I feel like I'm increasing it to the tumor as well it's just unreal cautious with that at least upper circulation you got to have upper circulation and brain to nerve you got to start rebuilding the neurons and you have to start getting blood flow in the brain more aggressively at the same time what else do we have to do we've got to get the lymph moving out of the head out of the body and get these lymph nodes open up and filtering through the kidneys right so you're after the kidneys and the adrenal glands you're after your uncle's kidneys and adrenal glands you also ask the lymph system but I would only use one lymphatic formula at first because this guy's really backed up and they've destroyed a lot of tissue the tissue they're destroyed has to go where to the lymph nodes which are already backed up they don't get that this thing when you damage tissue just just disappear magically yeah it's amazing so I'm going up that way if he's really really depleted that I am going on a I might interject some some green drinks a little parsley dandelion green if I could find that I'm going to interject a little energy a little a little a little adrenal power a little green a little a little chlorophyll but not much because I need that energy and the power and the nerve power of the fruits of the berries in the balance so that's what I'm going to do and I'm going after this guy in that way blood wise I need that circulation formula this is where they might get a little ketchup here but the problem isn't the blood the problem is the lymph system and that includes why he's stroke you didn't stroke because of the blood the blood is always alkaline why because it uses the calcium buffering system not the bicarbonate system it'll still and the proof is varicose veins spider veins herniation aneurysms how do you explain those and the only explanation is simple very very simple calcium is on the good side of the chain acids love to suck the election Alecto light out of are the electrons out of calcium the problem is sucking calcium out of matrix is that it becomes more matrix because you're in the presence of acids again proteins and then of course then you get the rebonding yeah if you can get the bone spurs and stuff I took him along all your herbs I must speak to you urgently please please kindly call me at your earliest convenience thank you so much things okay you want a caller what a car [Music] your call has been forwarded to an automated voice-messaging system three four seven seven eight two seven four are not available at the tone please record your message when you finish recording you may hang up or fret plus for more options hey Rose dr. Morris here honey I was just shooting a video talking about your uncle here honey so I'll try to get this video up as soon as I can maybe I'll let this one go up real quick I'll come back and shoot another one but I was going to call you on the YouTube and talk to you about your uncle so I gave you what to do on the YouTube with your uncle but remember I'm soaked I'm worried about the cancer and lower circulation but he needs upper circulation the very least for the stroke and brain a nerve fruits berries and melons only only only and you know you're going after those kidneys and getting filter and you're going after the adrenal glands and bump up the kidneys only one this body formula at first I would definitely liver gallbladder go after and aggressively in that way but at the same time you know you might get him a core feel rich drink once in a blue moon like a deadline green partially /all with some real powerful adrenal kidney mix though some beets in there beets are extremely strong at cleaning out the liver and kidneys real powerful so you give the little beet juice and that would work real well and then take him on down the road this way it has terms of blood thinners the perfect blood thinner on the plant is not a fitter and make some blood by constantly perfect as fruits berries and melons the perfect food to keep the blood perfectly then the circulation form is keep the blood perfect so you won't need so much about it is the lymph system is where the vascular wall is swollen is where it all is swollen it's the lymph system again as you know sweetheart so lots of love you rose try to get you later thank you much we got tried but that's what I would do with that uncle because you're getting him to the point where he's so fragile that if you're not real careful you're going to kill him so you got to be real careful out if you do with this guy that's time to detox it when I did the greens at first kind of get because you don't know what his body's lymph system looks like it's it's obviously backed up it doesn't have to be chronic because you can have a lymph node swollen in an acute condition but depending upon the genetic stance or awareness of a cell depends of how quick and acid will convert it look at these babies coming in with cancer cells already so that shows you these cells are already a typical at that level at conception almost it's like what I mean when you really trace the back and look at genetics and this or that excuse me we got a heck of a storm I feel like I'd like to get this up here before lunch I'll do a couple more maybe we'll break and start a whole new video would you like that and that way she can get that maybe we can get that up and she can look at that or uncle and look at that alright this is Bethany should I take your healthy pituitary capsules or your female reproductive tonic good question good question you why she's asking that she just insisted be healthy but to eteri capsules or the female reproductive tonic capsules because I have pituitary herbs in that smart question I'm a 29 year old with hyper andro genome or whatever you call it androgen of them Oh Joyce gets me hormonal acne well if you're Esther doing estrogen dominant dominance I'm not sure I think you can go after that pituitary no question but I would not I do it through the be a reproductive area I wouldn't hit the pituitary too hard unless you see a lacuna right there's a pituitary area I would probably do that remember when you're kicking up estrogen in your in your monthly cycles you're kicking up an acid when you kick up and after that's when you start to see more symptoms even if it's a low acid like estrogen this is a beneficial acid but it also can stir up the mix like your like your hormonal acne but it said again here's a good example of acid on top of acid it's a lady's monthly cycle when she starts to see more problems and symptoms because acids have kicked up in her body and when you take a woman that's highly acidic on top of that and enter and her glands are damn well she can have the worst right of her lifetime and that's that's that's not right or fair to females so it is on these guys and she's got like Palmas ok so this is me sweet on your very acidic of course and you're quite lating your lipids and this is under my left arm if you want to be careful here because of the left breast and the last lymph nodes and all of that so you want to get yourself up on a fruit and berry melon diet here after I get your eyes take a look at your eyes what do you little system look like at your age 29 years old blood your mom give you what your kidneys look like what's your adrenals look like what's your blood pressure on each side of your arms what's your what's your basal temperatures under your arm what's your thyroid doing what's your adrenals doing top number your blood pressure is it real low below 120 that's that's neurotransmitters that's fatigued and tired to say of course you can affect the cortex with all the cortisols and all the mineral utilization but all the other stuff out of the adrenals and if your pituitary is down that your monthly cycles can be off just that the hoard of things can go down with you including thyroid parathyroid all the other stuff all right here she goes she has your regular cycling on definitely pituitary definitely pituitary so you can try the female reproductive for me if you want or or you can do the pituitary herbal and add the parathyroid gland Euler and just take care of that parathyroid just in case case you want to have babies and you don't want any postpartum depression or any any calcium problems with yourself or with your children you might want to she brought the pituitary just bump on that pair of thyroid say for one bottle or something other wouldn't hurt and I tracked my kimba tree oh wow smart girl here chicken and sugars have been the main corporates in causing ovulation problems well anything acidic I think you're going to find a little more involvement with something's acidic you better get a little more bump of that I've tried being a raw vegan but I'm also having troubles with my insulin hoho some dates fruits can be a problem oh well this is at your age if this is not insulin insulin from the beta cells and it is actually your adrenal metabolism of that that would explain it because we go cortisol as well that would explain things arsalan giving you estrogen Accor estrogen dominance because your your progesterone levels would be lower very difficult to blood work to determine hormonal accurate hormonal levels I don't care what these endocrinologist say blood work hormonal levels are very inaccurate II determined what the body needs I'm going to tell you some of these are injured into introduced interstitially so very difficult yet to me you have to look at symptom ology knowing what each steroid doesn't for so I would say this go after your adrenal gland sweetheart and your kidneys couldn't hurt to go out to the liver going through your nervous system as well that could be another issue here that's coming to me so you want to go after that as well I would do either the I would do the pituitary herbal with a parathyroid just doing that for one month the next month cut down to the female reproductive for me and told them the ovaries of the uterus with it good fix this up she would like to have children and around three years this is a smart woman and this is a this is the kind of woman of today and tomorrow these are women warriors they're smart they're spiritual they think they're going to have kids when they're ready to have kids not have some emotional connection there they're looking at their health smartly no no this is a good woman right here so yeah you want to and of course you do have the acne telling your lymph system is backed up could be that pituitary suppressed your thyroid and your family trees engages some skin see if you have the skin ring around that as well sounds like you need to get opened up sweating and and filtering through your kidneys and just get your lymph system opened up bring the pituitary into some balance now if there's a pituitary witness there it might be something somebody there pineal gland so look at that as well but upper circuit brain endure for sure work with those to work with the adrenals and kidneys and see if that correct your blood sugar problem because if it's if it is the beta cells and it's an insulin problem and we want to work with those deliver gall bladder formulas will help that the pancreatic Department will help that we don't want you on any insulin that that's when you start having real troubles is when you take hormones or steroids now you can use other things first so that what you want to look at that get that correct but you get correct all this stuff up dear one and get your body of it and I love your thinking and smart and waiting to have the children getting your body healthy this is just a smart woman Bethany good good good good good being right there there's this carrot I care you will love it thank you hello you two and cue here thanks honey I've encountered so many spiritual awakening since fruit look at this this is pretty neat I've encountered so many spiritual awakenings since fruit and herbs some frightening most wonderful yeah some frightening for sure what's wondering what your perspective on hybrid fruits and herbs are wouldn't they be acid forming if they are man-made no not necessarily the only man cultured sort of spake grafted you know just grafting one to another and it's just like mixing different races together you know you're grafting you're mixing different varieties together and sometimes beautiful beautiful beautiful things come out of that I've always said when you mix a black and a white you have the most beautiful race on the planet beautiful gorgeous I mean it's just been you know can create some beautiful beads if you just start accepting everybody for who they are and their beauty and why they're here and getting to know each other good and enjoying the differences hey you're cool man look how you look you're neat looking now that sort of thing you know instead of looking at the negative all the time we're going to start turning around and think of all the positive things all the time I never was a negative thinker first I can't get along with that that type of thing when maybe acid-forming according to this dr. C I know but that's not true that's not true just because they're grafted differently it's not like your mom's Santa when you're really doing some nasty stuff yeah that's a little differently but grafting trees and stuff is just taking part of a tree and adding it to another tree an idol I don't see that there's sometimes they say that sometimes when you get away from the original strange you're lowering the consciousness or you're lowering the electrical parts of foods I've never seen any proof of that when you see people coming together they used to say the for example if you have two different ethnic groups coming together it makes a weaker group I don't see that I don't see that at all sometimes it makes for a smarter better group so I think a lot of things are missed out there and we've got to turn things into myths when it's a negative let's turn it into a positive you know start showing the world what humans are really made of and what what we can accomplish and the great things humans can be and the beauty of human can be absolutely that I mean the human can just be a tremendous being also thoughts an Irish sea moss have you tried it before I have and I am into Irish sea moss absolutely ancient civilizations with most of us tonight producing free energy you know they don't want that here though don't you realize they don't want you to have free energy look what Tesla was about giving everybody free energy with magnets and crystals right who's got that information now according to the History Channel the government came in and radios house soon after it's like what that stuff thanks thanks a lot Carol oh you know what there's so much weed remember this you know this because I'll have a hybrid job don't forget all those organic seedless concord grapes or hybrids well what but they'll kick your butt I mean they're so powerful and so good holy moly they kicked over Marcy's butt big types you have bought 17 big pounds of them and juice of a chug demand it's like ya know so sometimes people jump on these things and say things even doctors see it what was his name Phoebe or something like that but sometimes statements are made like that and you know not all of us can know everything I don't think as a negative against em or anything at all it's just that sometimes we make those thing to say it that's been put out there a lot though is that would we hybrid things things become weaker and I suppose has many cases that's true twitch or even talked about that but I come in and take a look at this a little deeper in my opinion that I don't see that I think sometimes mixing races is going to come out with a better race I do I just think that it's just how God is it's going to experiment that's all creation is anyway what do you think the all would need anything for the fun of it from the experience of it you know when you look at consciousness it's just is there's nothing to define it it's not like the mind and mind is where we define you know think about this this is kind of how it works would you you look at the autonomic nervous system I talked to some of you guys from class you're right Mac fact Meghan just told me the last eyes went out so all the eye pictures and the audios are out - you guys clearly want a job but your autonomic nervous system is that work could be nervous system right it doesn't for you it's it's duality its dualistic sympathetic parasympathetic comes to the back of the head picks up the the mastoid picks up the olfactory picks up the optic nerves picks up the central nervous system the overseer the central nervous system is simply the physical counterpart to the mind it is not the mind it doesn't think it's not awake it simply is made of cells that have response mechanisms to them we have when we smell taste see something that could initiate a fight or flight syndrome our central nervous system conveys that athira CLE to your astral body and to the mind the huge mind and that mind in a flash determines whether what I'm experiencing is going to be I'm going to look through the library the mind is nothing but a huge library of experiences I'm going to see if that brings about an experience that I've had before whether it's pleasurable or unhappy whether I need to fight run whatever I need to do and that all that emotional and all that input from your higher body's come through instantaneously hips the adrenals gets the adrenals neural transmitters as in epi and epinephrine norepinephrine and epinephrine to turn up energy to the nervous system it shuts down dopamine and the fetal goal is to shut down elimination shut down digestion to go for the muscles all that in a flash and you're initiating five different bodies including yourself because you are just the watcher of the movie that's all you are because you get involved in your movie doesn't mean you're you know that's where you lose yourself when you pull back and become the watcher of your movie you see all this interaction taking place and you get to determine the movie you want to watch instead of being lost in the mind and and your movie is kind of half-assed going around by your own myth or lack of self discipline thoughts so all of this takes place you are your consciousness your your awareness is watching as the byte is determining what the experience is all about the emotional sight is that is good or bad then you've got the physical counterpart what am i doing in relationship to what I'm experiencing or witnessing interesting stuff all that is set up by God in a flash in a flash so it's always good to have these bodies healthy and the nervous systems healthy and things like this we see tonight but he said it yep and the herbs are yeah I tell you it's hard to stay on fruit and herbs and not have spiritual awakenings it really is some fighting and some beautiful but I think more important than hybrids is the quality of raising if the soil is being nitrogen infused well that acidifies the tree when a tree when a fruit is picked on right your blue acidic stages are the growth stages nitrogen stages are the growth stages and fruits aren't like vegetables you have to pick fruits when they're right and then you have an erotic experience but we pick fruit unripe which makes it more acidic and then we acidify our fruit trees by using high nitrogen fertilizers and stuff and all of that is ridiculous so when you get in a grove or a fruit grower that uses mulch and and you're properly balanced nutrients oh oh the flavors and the beauty of that and the sweetness not the tartness the alkalinity sweetness comes right out amazing delicious I like these organic mangoes I'm about to cut into I'm about to have mangoes out the you-know-what walls ooh hello Jill hi I came across a video on YouTube by a chiropractor named Erik Bergman who describes why most people's bodies are too alkaline oh really here we go and that they need to take apple cider vinegar in order to acidify themselves chiropractor huh okay he says being to Auckland especially as we age results in inability to absorb calcium holy moly well you know I can't speak for his education that I can certainly tell you as a biochemist and as a healer of 45 years this guy's a wacko in his thinking and that thinking that is he might be a good guy on every other way but he doesn't obviously understand the body well because there's no conclusion you can make with that there's none we man eats a predominantly acid ash forming diet that's acid forming that's not outperforming so it isn't an outright ash that's blowing him up these are acid forming foods man doesn't eat all fruit and all festival you could you could try and make that argument try to make that argument with on all fruit diet you could try but the trouble is is that true today even if itself is not all alkaline it has its asset factors you know most fruits and stuff they don't go much over eight pH so hard to alkalize your to alkalize yourself with them even and this idea about inability absorb calcium that that doesn't have anything to do it a lot to do you must be in the aqualen state to absorb calcium but you also repair thyroid hormones I don't know what it's talking about in the absorption of calcium the absorption of kasi night Oh gal looking gone you are yeah you're not gonna go out and eat you sure well here I just hit that red little dot right there this little red dot be right back so I asked for you this I wanna take a look at the human body because okay what am i creating I'm creating lactic acid at an accelerated rate right all right so I'm increasing my respirations to keep up with the activity that I need right I'm up in my adrenals for more epinephrine and so I'll increase increasing my need for carbon so I'm going to be maybe increasing the liver breakdown of glycogen so I'm going to get some glucose so I can change that to ATP adenosine triphosphate or die or mono phosphate because I need that energy right because I mean I need that energy for activity all the tab emetic wastes they don't like down in to alkalize they've begun into acids activity is an acid experience you have acid steroids that the body it becomes very acidic it when you understand the body from an acid viewpoint then you begin to see all your answers and all your questions that you've had about the body and why man goes through what he goes through answered when you when you go by this chiropractor who is going by medical thinking you don't have any answers the proof his theory is wrong our theory is right how do we you want to prove it see I like proven things and we can say that this theory is wrong and ours is right but let's prove it I like to prove things so let's take his clients versus arc ice and let's take a look at them hugely different part of the chiropractic chain that also tells people to use high-protein diets these kind of people can kill people you put roses uncle on a high-protein diet you're just kissing that guy goodbye it's just isn't you see this all the time this is why I had packed here doing that one video on bicarbonate buffering the why we want to bring that out is to answer people like this guy who by living with this theory is missing out on ever doesn't understand that thing about health at all but these are tighter factors not to belittle I don't expect them to know about health they're not designed to know about health now really most of them are into supplements now and they've been into of course standard process labs for a long long time in fact a good friend of mine now the medical doctor he was a largest chiropractor in the countries when they got standard process actually somewhat stable so when they come up with stuff like that you guys got a feed through this because it's stupid it has is as stupid as the day is long when you're feeling pain and arthritis not you're not feeling alkalosis not at all you've lost a lot of calcium but only from the counseling buffering system calcium is alkaline it is not acid it's one of the great electrolytes of the body it is the main auckland principle in the body you know you can't have a body made up of a acid metal mainly we can't do it everybody has to be based dominant to fight to find this proper homeostatic saturation two big words just meaning that the body has come to a homeostatic a homeless homeostasis or a balance in chemistry that is at the saturation level where you're not going too far over one side to another you're not taking ripping too many electrons out of out of an alkali and creating that would be chaotic chemistry if you didn't have saturation this is obviously the opposite of what dr. Mercy's I would like to hear him come in on it the video was called the real reason apple cider vinegar works for losing weight Jesus Christ yeah well you know what my opinion ridiculously wrong and part of the problem not he's not part of the solution at all and these people write books out there and give wrong information there's you know the people that believe like this chiropractor are the medical people they believe that the body is predominantly in alkalosis now there's better medical doctors now understanding more about acidosis but my dentist is now just understanding acidosis if you don't understand acidosis and and the corrosiveness of acid and the calcium button and all you don't understand why they're symptoms if this chiropractor think that everything is alkalosis then he needs to explain to you all the diseases what causes them where they come from we can see what I'm saying so those sort of things I try not to let him rattle me too much go back and look at that video that patent I did she's an AFP professor and a medical doctor and I don't think anybody like this could begin to hope cup of tea sure because while she was here she cured healthcare a lot of people and she's been doing it for years on her own anyway a named Tom hey Tom deal dr. Moss I'm from Holland and very curious in health yeah the last few months I've been studying your videos and book I'm very interested in your theory of human health combined with herbal medicine absolutely I mean when you understand that man made up the concept of diseases then what are here for if not for body parts and of course that's what's exactly what they're for when you understand which herb is for what body part and it starts to make sense that the herbs are used for body parts of course there's herbs for the lip system herbs are tumors it's like incredible drugstore with things that work you know when you're used to herbs and how well they work it's like you feel naked without him like the saz and and four bytes and I mean to tell you I didn't even tell you how much I love herbs and Twitchell came out with herbs and magic healers a book way back and he here and then that they were indeed the magic healers and he wasn't that much of a vitalist he knew about health but he wasn't a vitalist and you know masters can only know what they're you learned themselves but he knew the herbs are the magic healers and they certainly are in every way about it if anybody doesn't like it say you'll be I had a huge discussion with my brother about your theory within believing it and his made knowledge about diseases I'm the only who believes in your theory at home cool his point was that I have no proof about your theory and he got really mad because of my belief well I'll say this Tom show him your theory show him our theory in motion in action in other words you can mentalize theories till the cows come home but it's only an intellectual dig you can sag arise or suck retain anything you want but there's only an intellectual dig on it and it means nothing in reality truth is that which is real and that which can be experience and so all you have to do is get on your diet get on the herbs and show them and let them show you their health as they get older on their diets and you show them your health on our diets see applied theories his applied theory look around right now you're looking at the medical and jilly the applied theory of man in relationship to his or her understanding of health or the lack thereof so when someone says that and you see death by the million that name everyone is sick isn't paid the average person has no clue how bad it is the average person walking on the street doesn't know that when they're walking down the street with all these people around them that ninety percent of them are in pain and suffering they just don't know it they don't see it they know are you okay to date if you went up on the street and interviewed and asked people how you feeling what's going on most would have problems including the younger ones look at how many young people we're dealing with your is that not sad that's their theory and they can they can fight back on that theory like this chiropractor can yell alkalinity all day long yeah alright but your theory doesn't hold any value of truth it's been applied it is being applied and all we see is not good stuff you guys have demonstrated our theory of light and always see if healings yeah sometimes you got some tough cases on their side death is the end result of their theory on our side you might go through some tough times but you are going to live and have a good life for those that I mentally are going to translate you're going to have a way of going about it you're going to be in a better mindset everything is good you're good you're going to work with your your chosen ones or your ones that are here to help you so Tom you just write up strong you ride with the theory that you feel comfortable with and show them you know we each must demonstrate the theory we believe in the world we believe in by our actions and you want to be healthy anyway who cares about the rest of your family you're the you're the one they're still lost in their thinking right now what do we got here a little small here and I can't pronounce the name at all so I apologize this is a name I can't pronounce but it says hi I was watching your video of dr. Morrison's on kidneys and adrenals you videos have helped me to understand my body way way better oh I hope so tyvm that's a face my health has been up and down for many years and 2014 I had breast cancer and while in the hospital they did a cardiac catheterization to Wow cardiac aetna well think about this though by the time you're diagnosed with the c-word therefore word for degeneration you've been through acute subacute chronic and now those cells are at the degenerative level so your body's already been through a lot of years of suffering to get to there or genetically speaking as we see in the younger kids because you can't take a healthy human cell and make it a cancer cell overnight and each sheet for murder as long as you have blood and lift flowing in and out of a cell cleaning and feeding and that elimination of waste are assured and the good nutrition coming in you have no matter fact I haven't thought of this in a long time there's one of the things I used to talk about we didn't bricks they did a study and they took a part of a chicken's heart within the years since I thought about this one they kept a piece of a chicken's heart alive for what 20 years does anybody remember that experiment and remember why that chicken's heart finally died one weekend everyone was gone out of the lab because they this experiment required two things two things to keep this part of a chicken's heart alive for that many years what two things forgot it cleaning and feeding you must feed but you also must clean you gives you a little baby home from the hospital you're feeding them but you also gotta clean them you don't just have one job you have two jobs right well let's see what your body has two jobs it has to feed but it also wants to eliminate mathematic waste how does it do that dump it into the blood yeah that's where people they don't understand the body well that's our people they just don't want to know that's all thinking that thinking is big I'll say quickly in medical thinking we've already dispersed it I did 20 30 years ago but medical thing is there finding little parts of the lymph system here and there of course that you know that's coming along but they kept a part of a chicken's heart for 20-some years and the reason you died they forgot to clean it it became acidic and died starting to create I'm just saying when the body is properly in a base dominant scenario there's no reason to have decay plenty of buffering systems for metabolism ways to limp no the kidneys everybody's filtering out the very nature of the foods you're eating is self cleansing self hydrating self astringent so it adds to all the chemistry of your food also adds to it not only to its food processing ability but also to its elimination because most of you realized by now that if you eat raw foods you don't have to wipe your bed but if you do it's one thing there's nothing on the paper because if the clean poop it starts that makes it sticky glue sticking at the white three and four tell you sounds bad but think about it from the health perspective sticky gluey mucoid plaque versus nice and cream and no smell so that you have to realize eating the right food your body's designed to keep it clean keeps it running keeps it up it's a nervous system on top it's the brain and the minds relationship in good order all these things good stuff but you have to realize the acids if you don't get them out of the body the blowback is inflammation and all that that means and most of these chiropractors stuff way out of their level of thinking but all this acid when you start to have lymph swelling you have stagnation to have stagnation in your body you have to have a blockage to have a blockage in your body what side of chemistry is mostly responsible for blockages acids why a combination and if the chiropractor doesn't understand that he needs to go take a chemistry course by helping you create coagulation until then when you shut down when you swell and shut down the kidneys ability to filter you're in trouble and when your thyroid goes down because it's full of mucus from dairy products and you can't sweat anymore then your skin goes down then a big part of your lymph system goes down there too just for meat drinking dairy products until the thyroid full of mucus and then suppress the thyroid but functioning and then suddenly you go cold suddenly you can't sweat just from drinking milk so that could set you up for anything being acidic that of course is they can call that the cancer the breakdown of the cell but it also can create plaquing of every kind everything is about look at what acids create the immune response called inflammation to calcium the cholesterol the edema not just the interleukins all the other stuff too I soon had a device inserted for radiation over the course of a watt I had breast cancer and while in the hospital they did a cardiac catheterization okay I soon had a device inserted for radiation over the course of a week what called a SAV bi catheter catheter ELISA sounds strange to me only had a small cancer stage 1 but I am on a cancer drug something of something for two years now and how to take it for another three but you really see what you owe me you said I'm on this cancer drug anastrozole for two years now I have to take it for another three somebody has standing over you with a gun or a club I mean by now you should understand that chemo isn't a curative factor and that they're going to take you from a simple stage one right on up the stages here they're the ones going to make your Stage one into Stage four of you don't stop it pretty soon you're a simple stage one you should have knocked this out you're a simple stage one breast cancer and you can't knock this out three or four months something's wrong and you've been two years on it two years you can regenerate the human body immensely there's a been a few that's still working after two years amazingly to me though I can't figure that one out but my what are you doing what are you doing on anok and a cancer drug chemotherapy for two years now I mean these guys are insane they're the mad scientist that have no facts and figures and people buy into them because their hair goes up like that alone I take other drugs forth iron style here we go BP asthma COPD a statin drug and a pain pill okay well welcome to the world of the medical okay so her thyroid is down all right the lymphatic system is the main reason tissue goes down your tissue never goes down because of your blood except an ischemic or when blood is and getting to tissue your teachers are going to die no question what would be the other reason then a cell would have a problem wouldn't be from the blood would it no it's from the lymphatic system absolutely in the blowback so I mean you have a device that initiates radiation what you allow people to put that into your body like that I would start increasing my awareness in my love for myself that would be the first thing I do and so telling these people their friggin nuts I mean you're you're you're making your little Stage one into something that you might not be able to stop you know stage ones these are these things that when you feel a little up one of those things are so easy to get rid of night date will go boom you're done if you can't get rid of an egg size tumor within within four months there's a problem here that's a much more serious one like lymph nodes and things like that but even stretch it to six okay so you your blood pressure's high that means what's what's involved kidneys and dreidels right well what causes their word cancer what causes tumors to back up what system the lymph system and what where's the lymph system kidneys and adrenal glands okay so your blood pressure is coming from the organs that you're having trouble with asthma copd okay so there's a neurological theft to that one it's not it's not pneumonia it's not just congestion it's neurological so you're back to your adrenal glands while you're having adrenal and kidney issues because now you're having lymphatic as you see that the adrenals and kidneys are your main links to the adrenal to your lymphatic system period your thyroid and skin are your second main links are essential to be working to have a great healthy body so your on so you need to have a practitioner because I could sit here and tell you what I do but you need a practitioner here to put your feet on the right path because you need an antispasmodic there's ways to work yourself right out of all of this well the statin drug I have to tell you if it was me I'd be I'd be given that back to my medical nursing you take it they're ineffective they do not start stop plucking of cholesterol and they do cause liver damage and many of medical doctors read Deepak while and to other medical doctors run a large article on the bad the bad side of statins Wall Street Journal or one of them we're going to rethink that you want to reflect your whole thing you want to rethink your chemotherapy you want to rethink your your device it initiates radiation these guys won't stop you're going to create more pain and more pain and more painting you to you you're going to have to go on morphine I mean they're got they're taking you down the road they're walking you down to hell build their walk they're not walking with you although they are in their own way you want to turn if you want well bill honey you got to turn totally around

500 100 get all this turned around save your gall bladder get yourself on your fruits marries and melons dying get yourself on an herbal program not here and there not this therefore this this or uh no you're too involved here you know an herbal program even if you just did the 14 week protocol but even cost that much to have a girls talk to you or a Atilla or sit it in and I'll write it up for you but do something now get on the detox kit weeks one and two get on a fruit Marabella melon diet I'll put yourself on a 20 day great diet and start it now start backing up on the things that's killing you that's all I can tell you you're on the wrong way street going the wrong way spinal stenosis here's a spinal stenosis adrenal I'd know the kidney cysts and adrenal and I never can pronounce that crack that gives me a tongue twister we'll leave it at that dr. Boyce I pray God will bless you with a long well thanks uh uh it means that to stay on this planet long uh no thanks we need you to show us the way back to health we're doing it we're doing it together we're all doing great here everybody Hill Hildy how to fall kill the damn it walk straight night it broke a rib messed up her knee Hildy had a fall out walking out Taikan you can't got that you've got some wild mountain terrains out there in the Badlands of I tell you my mother 70 and a half years old has a very severe case of spinal stenosis along with adrenal animal Edina both we call it an cyst on her kidneys she has been to the kidney caps and drops plus length plus adrenals into her grand I switched between the two good idea and stomach cancer almost a year no improvement oh well you know what man if she 70 and a half she's willing to you've got to get her up on the fruits and berries and melons he might be able to give her a salad a day but you've got to get her up on the diet the herbs alone not going to do this you got to get her kidneys filtering so you want to make sure you don't get to your get with her and you know tell her to pee in a jar make sure she's still stirring because you've got to get her filtering if you're going to correct this venosus error you've got to get the kidneys filtering you got to get all this acid hydration in ER and get get that involved that will start to hydrate these tissues after a while thats enosis will loosen up and all the calcium will go back into matrix or be excreted all of that will take place I can't believe why she has had no improvement less the diets involved the problem is getting your kidneys and adrenal glands back in shape because that's the doorway we need to fix this problem with it's just limp stagnation upper spine to lift it or back and all this you can work on the drill lymphatics can help her a little bit with that she's 70 years old so you have to work on the kidneys adrenals how to do kidney to kidney formulas one lymphatic formula say a lymphatic we'll start with one mover through a five of our our liver enzymes are good mover through the lymphatic v once and then back to number one again go after her just like you do I like the fact you're doing the adrenal I would do the adrenals and the endocrine gland both see what her blood pressure is see if it's coming down in good shape okay because you want her blood it might take you a while to get everything coming down and everything okay get those kidneys to filter so you just have to see how that is but dig it a little better with the diet that's her key if she's hitting any ask you to ask food that's going to slow her down she doesn't want to do that she needs to be a hundred percent raw and gone down that road you're you're talking about regeneration now and that is to take hardening and calcifications and dissolving them so the body has to be hydrated the lymph has to be filtering through and everything has to be breaking up and loosening up when that happens now when all c70 I do upper circle and lower circle brain and nerve to keep her alive and well that Lord sir can help a great deal in moving blood through the kidneys better that is going to help a little bit better infiltration the 24 hour drive fast and stuff I don't know where she got with that but I try to get her going because what should get her kidneys filtering you're going to see a lot better improvement quicker that's for sure I recently added the pain plus spasm drops some improvement but not constantly she is 98 percent fruit good deal good deal good okay she has much stress I'm unable to take good quality photos of her eyes you try inclined you try a 400 milligram adrenal gland euler on that to a sip that will bump up the kidneys a little better you can keep on the adrenal horrible site but you might want above that even if you just did a 200 milligram adrenal gland euler just to see if that's a little bump up because she could 70 she probably has real stagnation there and just don't get dismayed about just keep working toward worker worker the fact that you got a 70 year old lady on 98% treats pretty good I am taking your course but not learning fast enough to help her it's painful to watch her separate we'll call it to all the counselors again just get an appointment of an hour or something to talk to them and I beg you out of coursework yeah I don't like to see people suffer either I hate that I do too I can't stand it's easy to kill someone but to suffer that's not good what am I missing well you're doing the fruits I think that's good make sure that that 2% is anything acid-forming you got two kidney form as you wanted beaten up excuse me up late last night good sorry I can't go to bed till about 3:00 this morning I stay up and meditate and overview I'm trying to put this nature Pathak school together there's so many things I'm working on and working on this lymphatic Irish char I almost have it done there's none of these things coming I think and hopefully I'm getting some more books laid out and I there's just a lot of work to do but I'm hoping you guys will like what our future is and bringing out more truth and make it more accessible and it's just it's fun stuff but when you start to feel better and pulling people out of this despair you know but don't give up here the adrenals might be your connection you know you're saying she's under a lot of stress it keep our adrenals down with that bring her some flowers bring her out there and if she has any depression we're going to pair a thyroid a little bit you know bring that up a little bit as well everything is probably stagnant at 70 years old so invigorated energized keep working with that she is in a talkie honestly I'll see here's the problem right here and believe it or not and you guys will see that in working with others there's little adrenal glands called the Astro bar the astral body the emotional body yes I know that's tough okay go here she is she's in a toxic relationship and that will hold you down how good you're doing your make it hold you down and when your your mind is stronger than your physical body by far it is the creator of creation it is the creator of your drama your journey so your mind is and emotions are much more powerful than your little physical body so they can sit down and you can do it and this is a good case for this guy's doing everything right for his mother this could be even a female I don't know and yet the mothers slow to respond and I think one thing is this toxic relationship for sure because I have I think you saw the video of her she's a chiropractors wife and I had her up and walking at seven months and you see the video up there online there then she went over she's from I think checklist about here somewhere like that she went over and and spent some time with her family just for a couple of weeks or so her dad and her have an extremely toxic relationship she came back out being able to walk anymore and she struggled to get back to it and I don't know what the answer is sometimes to some of these things like that you know when you get into these extremely toxic relationships you have to realize these are Souls powerful beings that you're just maybe looking at their physical side but they also have an astral and a mental side I tried to tell her your dad could have a power over you and she thinks he does and it says you've got to get him off alia he's an entity to you you know these are just if you know everybody around you it's a different being you can call them humans or beings or entities or whatever else but when you're looking at someone with a physical body you're only looking at one little little bitty minor piece of them you don't see they're out unless you got that ability you don't see their astral body or their mental body or who they are as consciousness because we don't look at those now some of us are trying to look at those and we try to get you to look beyond the little physical shell - who is that being and that's true of your children - remember we talked about that who are these beings that you brought in here where did they come from what journey are they on what do they know we don't oh yeah oh no this is this is intriguing to say the least so she has to get get her warrior woman back she has to get into herself and say enough I've suffered from you're in a--they and you're your power over me enough you know there's a point when the ladies and the men but particularly the females say enough is enough from the abusive male principle from the acid principle because in more cases it's the males that are more abusive canape there's AB you see females no question she's constantly scared and stressed well there's your answer my opinion that's one of your big answers right there my friend working on it way out she needs to get out now maybe you can help her get out you know she needs help and the problem is if you don't start out in a relationship where you keep your own checking accounts your own things the mail summertime has dominance they control the purse strings and everything and the woman has no chance of getting out but I've helped some get to halfway houses and then they go back so you have to work this out you know I don't know you have to work this out in the meantime is there a way to reverse her conditions absolutely reversal just to do everything you're doing like we were just talking about but you have to have learned how to cut off the relationship excuse me uh-oh you coli she has to ask to stand up to her relationship and say no if she fears a beating that she needs to call the cops but they don't take that you know cops in this country very seriously now I don't know about in other countries but they take this domestic abuse extremely seriously you can get your button jail for doing stuff like that see I'm going to take a little break here let me go over one more I said just grab one smaller one here so we'll come back I got all week we've got to have a week yeah rainy weekend I'm going to sit here and we'll come back after lunch and go through some more maybe we'll cut this one off and do it do small words how about let's do that well do small ones I'll do another one this afternoon and then I'll do a couple tomorrow and I just calling that something comes up this is day hi my name is Dane from Louisiana I'm a 24 year old male with extreme depression and anxiety I don't like that all right so now let me ask you 24 years old you balding see when you have depression right off you know there's a pair of thyroid weakness I want you all know depression is not not something that's mental depression generally is a actual physiological issue low calcium utilization did you have growing pains growing up in your legs hurt you feel like you had muscle pain that's another sign of low calcium utilization is what they call growing pains but we're looking at the parathyroid gland and the parathyroid gland is where you utilize calcium so you want to take a look at your parathyroid get a picture of your eyes bro take a look at your parathyroid look at your pituitary if you're going balding I submit to you your pituitary suppressing your parathyroid and can be also suppressing adrenals I I get it about I could probably make almost a blanket statement and say that 99% of all 24 year olds have adrenal and kidney weaknesses worldwide and I probably would be pretty damn close to being accurate so you already set up for anxieties and a nerve neurological weakness that's why there's so much AED and so much of this end vaccine in the vaccinations worlds they don't understand what's going on and the fact that people are born with chronic myelin sheath depression and weaknesses they don't get that all these babies are not come from the same cell in the same fabric so at 24 Big Time so these are definitely genetics so you want to take a look at the pituitary look at your Heights look at all these things involved but your eyes will tell the story right off and you can correlate with that with all the other stuff clinically I'm on the SSRI I know I'm not sure what this drug is ten milligrams currently I was at 40 mil all you got down to ten which is good but slowly reducing my dose because if the side effects oh god yeah well to back it up you want to put yourself on a hundred percent raw you want foods that make you smile fruits make you smile because they taste good they they're neurological they enhance your comprehension levels so fruits and things that taste like that berries those are really good for that you can use some flower essences instead of pharmaceuticals even to titrate even more get moonshine URL here from fox farm running Fox farms really great lady great great running Fox farms and there are great flower essences I think they're better than the Box myself but you could get she has emergency relief you could get that as well use flower essences to support you but you wouldn't go into your body go after your adrenals and kidneys go nuts with herbs and and and I guess if your blood pressure is real low broken on the glandular for your adrenals that's your patch your anxiety your emotions your breathing that's that side of it depression and hun that we're up here now we're up here and that you want to correct that parathyroid that because that could be skeletal system Oh your skeletal system and everything else so you want to really go after that parrot and I'm going to say that probably a pituitary I'm going to have to go after that I've been watching your videos for a while now and recently ordered the fat for kit to help move lifts and really want to get upper circuit brain of nerve I would do upper circuit brain and nerve at 24 if you can afford this upper circuit brain and nerve you're going to love it then I'm going after my endocrine glands I'm going after mic my adrenals my parathyroid my pituitary cuz I can tell you probably that but I'm also going after those kidneys and I'm going to get filtration I'm 24 years old if I'm not filtering I'm in for some serious trouble and if I involving I know I'm in for serious trouble so I'm going up a circuit bring the nerve right off right I'm trying hard to stop eating meat because of the high acidosis but when I eat only fruit I'm always hungry a couple of hours later is something else well my man you might want to close your ears ladies be worm yourself you might want to do the first kit you know it's a tip that opens up everything it D worms everything you might want to get back and he fungal yourself and D worm yourself because generally when you're hungry like that sometimes you have other people involved and you might want to you know kind of clean house a little bit that way and then everything will settle down to that and get used to wanting to feel a little hungry when you're detoxifying I'm just saying when you're detoxifying you want to push away from the table just a little hungry because it will help it will help detoxification well but if you fill up constantly full you'll take some of that detox energy out remember the body is the one that detoxifies itself we're just giving it the power to do it we're giving you the energy the nutrition we're taking your way digestive and energy and all this we're giving it things that that that help it to clean itself astringent value chemistry high electrolytes to bring hydration and break the particle emulation and break away the acids in the pain reduce the swell and get all the email because everything is going back to normal that chiropractor can't do that for you because he believes the opposite of that and as long as he believes that he'll never be a healer at all you might be able to send snap crackle pop but they doesn't say he's a good healer and that also brings into question his ability to do that when you're off of your biochemistry and your healing and you don't understand health that I also want to take a look at your chiropractic understanding and do you know kinesiology and all the other stuff that would make you a better chiropractor I'm going to read one more this is from Ashley Ross holy crap I can't even pronounce that word painful fingers hello my name is Ashley and I'm 17 years old 17 she's just getting your license to drive and have some fun in life all right and ever since last year when she was 16 and the early spring I've been experiencing terrible finger pain is that what that mean this hydrosis don't like that at first it started off small and I thought it would go away but then the flood filled blisters now pop that blister get yourself a pH paper and test the flood in the pH in the blister I'm going to show you something and it's not alkaline what is it going to be any acidic absolutely that's your lymph system those little blisters that's lips let's see how that flood pops that's acidic limp would absolutely it just shows your segment there and you got to get your kid but you're only 17 years young so that tells me as a healer that tells me right off you're not filtering it she probably has the adrenals down and what else because she's only 17 years old and and 17 year olds and younger really getting genetically beat up if you come from good gene family you're lucky why so first I'm small and I thought it would go away but then the fluid-filled blisters increased on my pointer finger on my right hand then they spread to my finger and ring finger then to the pointer finger on my left hand I think the cause may be stressed due to all the academics well this is your adrenal glands and this is your lymphatic system the stress on top of that oh yeah you're right on your right on honey yep absolutely your stress and trying to get through the academics and stuff like that and that's my point school should be fun not stressful and you're learning all this crap from other people and it's needed when you're into aerospace and thing of course but not in this profession not in this profession half of what's already written is not even true so that's a problem there but you want to go I think the cause maybe says well that's as compounding the problem by shutting your adrenals down even more stressing that lower back and kidneys and you know just get a jar and peeing at dr1 just get yourself a mason jar and pee in it tonight or whenever you see this video and take a look if it's clear you're 17 years old you're in trouble your kidneys are not filling at 17 years old that's a problem but I attest to you that probably with all these this blisters like this these acid things yeah and you probably have some viruses in your body as well you know so you really want a big detox clean out the body get the kidneys still to make sure your skin is sweating and that you're if you can't sweat come down to Florida here for a few weeks and work in my Gardens I'll get you sweating and open up your doors get all these acids out and all these will recede and go away if not you're going to start getting real stiff and tight and sore and here goes the elbows and there goes the NAR just one thing after another then there goes the body this isn't good because you don't want to get into the scleroderma can any of these kind of nightmares from holy heck getting into these high acid eye conditions at your age and no no no no turn this around on yourself here I undertake and the sleep deprivation I endure throughout the school year honey well trying to spend time and using your mind but you need to spend time while you're studying study and kick back and meditate and allow yourself to see what you just studied don't let the mind always try to figure it out because you over stretch yourself the might is not seeing what you're studying it can't figure it out anyway you know your unique individual so let that kind of let that kind of have time to filter back and let the mind have a chance to put it in its proper librarian category because that's what your mind does it's going to put all this information in your own life you in your own library it's got its library but that's the universal mind you're engaging your individual mind so you want to do that but you want to pull back from the mind and look at what you're learning not try to intellectually see what you're learning you want to look at what you're learning from a distance and see how it fits in what you're studying and you'll understand it more if you keep learning from the mind thought thought thought cramming and I'm going to I'm going to remember this and make myself remember this and this and this and this that's the worst way to learn there is because then you're ruining my memory and when you get out in the real world memory doesn't noise suit you so when you pull back you want to know where what you're learning and where it fits while you're learning it because there's an old saying in education and I had in high school if you think you're going to go back and restart this you're wrong the chances are you going back and resetting something is ridiculous you want to learn it in the moment of learning but you want to learn it from how it fits into all of things and it'll stay with you better just saying there's a little secrets in learning and you Kayson keeping the mind learning separate then your consciousness a little bit takes a little work to learn I'm here to tell you about y'all it's a lot more freeing and you will always have the memory and you will know instead of require memory knowing something is a lot different than conjuring up the memory of something so just a little pointers there I think let me see I've been very distressed because I get so discouraged about my skin I thought so and I want to find what is causing it well you only have to look to one-fifth and notice that there's no blood in those puss Euler's there's no blood is there that's why it's not interesting so it's less blood yeah and it just shows that your cup of runneth over my gear and now your skin is showing these bumps and expenses like little pimples and tumors and boils and v you know just drinking milk I used to get boils all the time then it's all mucus forming all burden some lymphatic system and then when the body goes to get rid of it everybody freaks out well call cold or flu-like symptoms rashes and pustules and all kinds of things on the skin when your body gets loaded it's trying to get it out well medical like all we got to stop that well that's what happens in time when you stop the acute when you stop this subacute when you stop any of these stages you're making for the deeper stages there wouldn't be chronic and degenerative conditions if everybody always cleaned up your acute conditions easy just put it in the food that's created no but learn how to maybe do that little dip and dig in and get your get your thyroid up here dear 1 2 where your basal temperature is under your arm or around 98 because you want to sweat you want to open up subcutaneously you don't want to hold these active vendor because then you'll pop these little pus Euler's all over the place and you get something kidney cysts on this system that if it is what happens and it's the lymphatic system this is the blood system there's only two in there which when you go to pick you know people make like the body sub deep mysterious throw you your things go want it quit it stop stop your car is mysterious until you learn why how its put together and everything has a reason for existing this turns us on this is the best I can't

Lee Health is a nationally recognized, award-winning health system in Southwest Florida. We are caring people, inspiring health.

The numbers are surely attention getting: nearly 7 million Americans have undiagnosed diabetes. What gets less notice are the early warning signs. 

""If they're not going to their doctor, if they're not seeing their physician they're not having those lab works, they're not reporting their signs they could just be going along with their normal daily activities,"" says Melanie Aracri, a certified diabetes educator for Lee Health. 

All too often patients show up at a hospital in a health crisis and find out they have highly elevated blood sugar. New studies find 1 in 10 heart attack patients may have undetected diabetes. We've broken down 5 warnings signs that should get your attention.

""The three classic signs of high blood sugar, we call them the three ""P""s:  polyphagia, polydipsia, and polyuria. Those are increased thirst, increased hunger, and increased urination,"" says Aracri. 

It's easy to minimize increased thirst, especially when it's hot. And frequent urination seems to naturally follow. But experts say it could be our body's way of flushing extra glucose.

""The kidney has to work really hard to get that blood sugar out, that blood glucose out when it's high,"" says Aracri. 

Wounds that don't heal could be another warning sign.

""The body's not able to fight that infection because of that extra glucose in the system,"" says Aracri. 

Frequent yeast or urinary tract infections may also be a red flag many people fail to consider. The earlier diabetes is picked up, the easier it is to avoid complications.

""it's a learning how to adapt your eating pattern, your meal plan to your lifelong activities and daily habits,"" says Aracri."	153000.0	PT1M46S	2d	hd	False		0.0			752786.0	3574.0	0.0	1472.0	2010-12-21T20:04:58Z	Lee Health	49354355.0	the numbers are surely attention-getting nearly seven million Americans have undiagnosed diabetes what gets less notice are the early warning signs if they're not going to the doctor if they're not seeing their physician they're not having those lab works they're not reporting their signs they could just be going along their normal daily activities all too often patients show up at a hospital in a health crisis and find out they have highly elevated blood sugar new studies find one in ten heart attack patients may have undetected diabetes we've broken down five warning signs that should get your attention the three classic signs of high blood sugar we call them the three P's polyphagia polydipsia and polyuria those are increased thirst increased hunger and increase urination it's easy to minimize increased thirst especially when it's hot and frequent urination seems to naturally flow but experts say it could be our body's way of flushing extra glucose the kidney has to work really hard to get that blood sugar out that blood glucose out when it's high wounds that don't heal could be another warning sign the body's not able to fight that infection because of that extra glucose in the system frequent yeast or urinary tract infections may also be a red flag many people fail to consider the earlier diabetes has picked up the easier it is to avoid complications learning how to adapt your eating pattern your meal plan to suit your lifelong activities and daily habits for Lee Memorial Health System I'm Amy Roscher	High Medical Info

"Attorney Cal Warriner discusses his experience with litigating the various bad diabetic drugs that have hit the market. Each time a drug maker has tried to produce the ""new and improved"" diabetes drug as a  breakthrough treatment, a more dangerous drug was produced. The latest ""newest and most improved"" diabetic drug is Onglyza. A recent study demonstrates a substantially higher incidence of heart disease and death than diabetics on other treatments."	3980.0	PT4M58S	2d	hd	False		0.0			512.0	3.0	0.0	1.0	2009-01-29T19:23:21Z	Searcy Law Video	2004391.0	I want to talk to you for a minute about a new project that we're taking a very serious hard look at because of our experience in type 2 diabetes mitigate medication litigation going all the way back to rezulin we've always had a significant interest when companies launch a new drug that is supposed to be better than the last drug was to treat type 2 diabetes going back forever treatment for type 2 diabetes basically that's that's the non insulin-dependent form of diabetes typically was controlled by a drug called metformin which is proven to be very very very safe diet and exercise well we know human beings they're not real fine fond of controlling their diet or their exercise and metformin alone sometimes is not enough to control patients type 2 diabetes you got to put all three together so companies have worked real hard to come up with a magic drug so you don't have to really pay attention to your diet you don't have to really pay attention to your exercise and you can just take the magic drug and it will fix your diabetes going all the way back to rezulin which was the first groovy new drug that was designed to treat Type 2 diabetes we found that when you took rezulin you ended up with liver failure so it was bad for people so then the newest drug came out on the heels of rezulin touting itself as being better than rezulin without all those risks it was called Avandia pretty soon they figured out that advant increased a patient's risk of having coronary artery disease heart attacks congestive heart failure and problems like that and so the next thing you know Avandia kind of goes away and on the heels of Avandia came Actos Actos was just exactly like Avandia Actos marketed itself as being the new better drug to treat type 2 diabetes that didn't have all the risks that Avandia and rezulin had well pretty soon reports and studies started showing that people who took Actos had a significantly increased risk of developing bladder cancer from they're Actos so third drug third problem serious health problem as a result of taking this simpler easier drug on the heels of Actos we've got Byetta and januvia that came out again identical marketing scheme better than Actos better than Avandia better than rezulin and pretty soon januvia and Byetta have been leading to the development of thyroid cancers and pancreatic cancers so I don't know for my dollar I would rather work real hard at controlling my type 2 diabetes with diet exercise and metformin then expose myself to the risk of developing pancreatic cancer by taking in the magic drug not long after that we have invokana that was launched in bokken another type-2 diabetes medicine in bo Khanna ketoacidosis problems significant litigation over invokana and finally on Eliza only gleizes the drug I really wanted to talk to you about again another miracle drug type 2 diabetes medicine just take a pill you can remain you can you can continue to eat poorly you can continue to not exercise you can just kind of be lazy and control your type 2 diabetes with this magic pill problem that is starting to be questioned about owning lyza is does it cause congestive heart failure there is evidence in a clinical study that was done on Oneg Eliza where the control group was actually a group of diabetics on diabetic medication and it was shown that Oneg Eliza has a substantially higher incidence of causing congestive heart failure and death most people would say wait a minute diabetics that's one of the things diabetics can have they can have heart disease diabetes causes heart disease well the important thing about the study that I just referenced looking at Oneg lies is the control group was diabetics on diabetic medication so you're comparing apples to apples there and even comparing apples to apples the only gleiser group had a significantly increased risk of developing congestive heart failure and died and the patient's dying from that so we've been involved in litigations going all the way back to rezulin we participated in every single one and we fully anticipate if the science ultimately bears out that Oneg Eliza has a significantly increased risk of causing congestive heart failure we are going to be involved in this litigation as well	High Medical Info

second to join us hi good morning hello hey I haven't done a periscope in a few days I think I've been too busy having that time good morning hi I'm gonna give everybody a second to jump on hey how is your day going so far is it great I'm real tired hello i am debbie and i am a mother who is crazy and i want to talk to you thank you for the hearts and if you're watching the replay you can also continue to tap the screen to show your love and you can type if you're new to periscope I had some friends asking me last night what is periscope so you can interact you can type to me and talk or ask questions I love feedback I love interacting with you on this beautiful North Carolina morning I'm not driving I am not moving see no moving scenery I'm still at the park we're going to talk about ways to increase your water intake I don't know if you feel like you're drinking enough water or not so maybe you can kind of decide it's obviously a little bit different per person and your activity level most people say to drink half of your body weight in ounces so if you're a hundred pounds you would drink 50 ounces if you're 200 pounds you would drink a hundred ounces I don't know that I'm exactly in that camp with hydration it's so important that I recommend for females having nine to twelve minimum with a goal of more closer to 15 and really the easiest way if you like to keep the math straight is just to have a cup of water per hour so it's not like you can chug those nine cups at the very end of the day and really feel like you're actually being hydrate good so do you guys feel like you're staying hydrated like you drink enough water during the day let's hear from you type it on in I think everybody's still trying to wake up I am too nothing okay so I'm gonna share thumbs down not even close coffee no coffee counts coffee is made with water so we're gonna count that just like tea is made with water and I'm really being serious I'm not giving you like an easy out I really think that that can count as a supplement to your water so high five that's awesome one recommendation I have for getting more water into your life 80 ounces is great that's 10 cups perfect yeah I try to pour a big water bottle you like to chug it like medicine I do that sometimes too especially in the afternoons do you drink more if you're sick I tend to drink the same but it will definitely help flush all of that out I think staying hydrated is super important so I get water bottles that are really big this is my favorite it's thermos cuz it's leak proof that's the best this one holds three cups so what helps me is having a big water bottle so I have to fill it less often I am a creature of laziness and so I'm gonna make sure that i only have to fill that a certain number of times a day so three cups I usually will drink five of these a day I have a bigger one that holds four cups so I do four of those a day but I do why don't half gallons a day awesome my goal is a gallon a day if I can get pretty close depending on if I exercise or not I am thrilled to the moon I fill up my water bottle as i go to bed so it's ready for me the night before now i don't need ice-cold water and everybody's different in that respect but if you need ice put ice in it at bedtime it'll still be chilled when you wake up and that way i have it ready in the morning while i'm getting ready i've made it part of my routine part of my habit that i'm going to do this and you can even consider making it into a game that you're not allowed to have your morning coffee until you've had your water at least three cups try to start my day with three cuts your organs need it you've been in fasting mode all night and so you want to make sure that you're starting your day with lots of water so consider oh thanks for the hearts consider like okay no coffee until I get up and take it like medicine like you're talking about or maybe you like to sip on it through the day I do recommend having one cup per hour to stay on top of it to stay on top of that hydration to stay alert throughout the day I personally am NOT a lemon water fan but I'm I like other people to drink it I just I don't want it I like plain water but lemon water is super good for you lemon has like super food benefits so absolutely flavor your water with lemon or orange or mint or cucumber or frozen berries if you don't like the taste of water you can kind of ease into it by infusing it in that way and like you mentioned there are great water apps there's one called waterlogged so waterlogged which i think is kind of a cute one and then there's another one that's free that's called daily water and it's just a free app that's going to remind you to drink if you don't want to get an ant app set an alarm to go off every 60 minutes that's your reminder of I gotta have a cup of water and by the way a cup of water is about four gulps so i recommend nine ounces nine ounces i apparently need more coffee you need at least nine cups a day really 12 cups a day is fabulous and if you can get 15 so somewhere in the nine to 15 cups each day those of you who are my nutrition clients your goal is 15 if you're new to drinking water nine is gonna make you feel like you're drowning and you're gonna have to go pee all day long so i pee like a pregnant person all day long because all i do is chug water I'm not allowed to have other drinks until I've had all that water now I can still have coffee to who but so another way to add water we've talked about putting it by your bed at night so it's ready morning part of your new habit in the morning is to drink water you can't have coffee until you've had at least three cups of water you're going for 9 to 15 cups a day and there's the app waterlogged or daily water or you can just set an alarm that reminds you and then after a few weeks you won't need those alarms you won't need those reminders another thing you can do if you have various water bottles is to write on them or put masking tape on them and so at each little bar your thanks for the hearts you're going to say by 9am by 12pm by 3pm by 6pm and I do start trailing my water off at the end of the day because I don't want to have to get up and pee at night so I do try to have all of this water in me by like seven o'clock I try to really cram it in so that I can sleep through the night but yeah we did talk about how coffee is made with water tea is made with water and vegetables and fruits have water in them for crying out loud so for those i kind of consider a supplement i still want to drink the regular water and you can make your own flavored water you're not going to make like Crystal Light or what are those little squirty things I can't remember all those names that's that's not good that's not what I'm talking I'm to my actual orange slices actual root and I also think it's helpful to increase your water intake by having oh the me oh that's what it is that stuff is so unnecessary don't buy that sorry if you work for that company Oh another thing that's helpful for me is to keep it nearby I again am so lazy that if it's even another room or maybe if you go to the office and you're like oh I left my water in the car you're probably not going to go get it so keep it nearby have a big one so you don't have to fill it up all the time I don't I don't buy any water bottles that are under 24 ounces I refuse it just takes I'm just too lazy I want this to be as easy as possible for me so I'm going to make sure to keep it nearby and another thing that you may not have thought of is using a straw you may actually drink more water if you use a straw something so simple that you're like of course and you do want to make sure it's the temperature that you prefer I like lukewarm water which makes probably some of you feel very sick my husband has to have ice cold water my kids want ice cold water so obviously you want to try to make it as as pleasing as possible and I would love those are that's my list okay so i had my list of suggestions how do you drink more water a lot of you said that you may not drink enough but you are drinking some so what habits do you do now to increase your water intake because water can prevent those headaches it removes those toxins it's so good for you and I think you can get addicted i used to be a mountain Dew addict and I'm not anymore yay so change is possible and now if I don't get water first thing my head starts to hurt and I actually feel like I'm a raisin like I need to get plumped back up so what suggestions do you guys have on the other side of this awesome periscope broadcast and while you're typing that in by the way make sure you're following me on all social media fit with dead I have lots of YouTube workouts and nutrition help recipes and then I have a great facebook page where I give tips all throughout the day and of course instagram I love it does become a habit if you stick with it yeah it is hard to get when you're really busy I've had those days where I am so busy I really I'm like I don't even have time to get up to go get some water it's really important that's when those phone alarms they're so annoying but they really remind you like a right all right I'll just get up I'll take the 30 seconds and then keep the water next to me and you just have to remind yourself with those alarms and have that straw have that good flavor so you're craving it yeah working out is that's another good way to drink water I usually drink about three more cups a day if I do work out so yeah that's definitely a motivation that's a good idea what other ideas do you have about drinking more water during the day i love these hearts they're so delightful y'all are great i think that's all the ideas I have I'm ready to start a group work out and make these girls chug their water you don't want to get nauseous by going without and you get bonus points if you eat your water throughout the day in the form of fruits and vegetables and then of course plenty of coffee I've talked about coffee before but that is a good way to get your water in I've got my Disney mug of coffee right now drinking it black not with creamer the coffee has tons of benefits as well which is a whole different periscope but I'm going to jump off for now I'm so glad that you join me now now that we have this periscope go drink water remember one cup is just like four mouthfuls of water that's easy you can totally do that thank you so much for joining me make sure you watch the replay if you miss this you can still give hearts as you watch the replay and I will connect with you on all forms of social media today ok message me with your questions and I'll talk to you later bye	Low Medical Info

quality coffee for like a dollar 20 using any of the vending machines and then you just tap a Suika card or IC card but I was able to make one in Apple wallet it's super easy God I love coming to Japan anyway I'm here at C Tech 2019 hopefully it will be one of the shows that I go to every year in the rotation of tech shows and what I noticed is that a lot of the tech as being showcased at this more business-to-business show happens to be health oriented which makes a lot of sense in general but one of the main finds that was here in the hall seven or eight of C Tech 2019 was a product that I was inspired to bring up and use as a resurrection of type two foodie hey it's Josh Vergara what's going on everybody let's take a look at this little piece of tech that might be able to monitor your blood glucose levels without having to draw actual blood all right so this particular product is being developed by Kyocera but this little device that uses gyro sensors presses up against an artery that's right here below the area of the thumb underneath the palm in order to measure blood flow and a few different metrics about it now it's a little bit tough for me to talk about the science behind this and I was really curious about it but unfortunately with some of the language barriers and even with an interpreter we weren't really able to get some hard facts about the science behind this lifestyle product now it's really important for me to say lifestyle product because Kyocera does not want this to be considered a full medical device and I think one of the main reasons why is because the accuracy of this device might still be a little bit in question but it could give you a little bit of a snapshot into your overall health when you measure your levels before a meal ends at a certain time after the meals any type 2 diabetics out there like myself know that these are very important metrics how your blood sugar reacts to the food you eat all right so here's what one of those tests actually looks like I have the gentleman measure what they call just my carbohydrate level and they pressed this gyro sensor right up to the large artery under my hand somewhere around there at least and I was already feeling a little bit out about it because I had tested my blood sugar earlier in the morning to see what my fasted levels were and I didn't eat all the way up and so this particular moment so let me just cut to the part where I ran right back to the room to test my blood again to test that accuracy all right so I just got back from getting that rating done I just wanted to cut to this real quick because I got really curious I'm still looking up a couple of journal sites and some articles that state that this kind of measurement actually gives you an accurate reading of your blood glucose now generally for people like me who are type-2 diabetic we have to use devices like this so you probably are familiar with little blood glucose meters like this where you put a strip in you put some blood in and then it gives you what should be a fairly accurate reading so I'm gonna do that right now and the reading was around 1:40 based upon the device that we're talking about in this video so let's see what happens here alright so there you go 110 so I know that my blood sugar is at a pretty good level 110 is pretty good for a type-2 diabetic like myself but I'm really curious and I guess I'll talk about it a little bit later after I cut away from this quick segment that I did just to talk about how something like a gyro sensor or a gyroscope would actually show you what the trends in your blood glucose might be because that's what this product is supposed to do you take a measurement before your meal and then you take a measurement sometime after the meal and it gives you some of the trends and gives you a look at what your carbohydrate intake might do to you so I can't really speak to the science buying all of this but I don't think Kyocera wants to either again this is a lifestyle device not a medical device so it's just a way for you to know generally how you are how you're feeling what you should probably look out for and then you go to the medical devices to figure out the actual data after that but for anybody out there that wants to have a good snapshot of their health and they might be diabetic this is a great way of doing so without having to worry about the lancets and drawing blood and all of that stuff so it might actually be more accessible to people who are a bit skittish about that and honestly I'm still curious about the science behind checking a blood flow or blood pulse as a way of measuring blood glucose levels and if anybody out there knows the science behind it please let me know link it in the description below this is a study that I found trying to connect heart rate variability which is a new type of metric that we're starting to use more in the US as a way of measuring blood glucose levels over time and as long as the variance is rather high meaning that it's not the exact same beat each time especially if your heart rate is high that means that your body is less stressed and you might be a healthier person overall so kind of in a nutshell that story found that with higher heart rate variance or HRV those people generally had less hyperinsulinemia and also lower blood glucose you know you got to respect the hustle she's trying to sell the food to all the people who are trying to go to the conference right now so it's only Gehry which I would love to eat but this is type-2 foodie we're talking about anyway the takeaway is pretty obvious I want to see more devices like this in the diabetes world because some people might be a little bit squeamish about actually drawing blood all the time and it's something that we diabetics have to live with all the time something that's a bit easier something you can use at any time and something that's not invasive that would be huge for monitoring one's glucose levels and for managing diabetes in any case I'm gonna go ahead and call it on this one thank you so much for watching look forward to more stuff that I'm doing here in Japan I'm trying to do a lot of stuff here because I love being in Japan I have a lot of tech that I want to show off fewer views and obviously type-2 foodie is every Friday so stay tuned to my channel for even more things about health type 2 diabetes stuff like that I just want to talk about every Friday on the segment called type 2 foodie I'm gonna walk away from the onigiri and make sure I don't get tempted and you know what I'm just gonna go ahead and remind you to to enjoy your tea everybody	High Medical Info

peripheral arterial disease pad how do you know if you might have it what kind of signs and symptoms do you look for the answer is simple wounds and or leg pain those two things allow me to elaborate wounds think about when you were a kid and used to ride your bike in the neighborhood with your friends once in a while you try something you probably shouldn't have maybe a ramp or going over a curb and you fall and you skin your knee so it happened to all of us and maybe you'd cry or not go to your mom you know soothe you like moms do and she'd put a band-aid on it then a couple days later you'd notice that the wound you don't need the band-aid anymore it kind of dried up a week later it's almost gone and a month later you forgot about it if you look down on your knee you can't even tell where it was how did this happen it's the miraculous healing power of the human body the human body is a miraculous thing it can heal itself your body senses that there's a break in the skin there there's damage there and your body sends a repair crew through the arteries it sends red blood cells it sends with oxygen it sends white blood cells which are the repair crew it sends different nutrients and that repair crew starts working and healing that wound it's amazing and in a month your skin needs back to normal you're back on your bike running around the neighborhood right that should happen with all wounds in your body not just your knee anywhere if you cut yourself it should heal a couple days in a week it should go away it should be a progressive healing if you have a wound on your legs feet or your ankles and it's not healing or it's healing very slowly something's wrong that's not normal there's three major causes for slow or non-healing wounds in the legs ankle feet first one is pad think about it if your arteries are clogged which is what pad is or narrowed not enough arterial blood is coming to that wound so oxygen can get there nutrients can't get there the white blood cell repair crews can't get there so it's not going to heal so if you have a wound that's not healing or slow to heal it might be pad give us a call come see us let us evaluate you we're not going to do any procedure it doesn't hurt non-invasive we're going to talk to you we're going to do an ultrasound we're going to do an abi and a few other things we're going to see if you have pad if you do we can do the procedure that will open up those arteries not the same day on a subsequent day so the number one symptom of bad is non-healing or wounds or wounds that are slow to heal on your legs ankle or feet the number two symptom is leg pain so when you have leg pain do you think well bad most people don't most people think it's like arthritis and in most cases it is to be fair but if you have leg pain and you don't have arthritis or you feel like pain when you're like sitting around doing nothing that's not normal that may mean that your arteries are not your legs aren't getting enough arterial blood flow the tissue the tissues your skin your muscles not getting enough blood and it hurts it's just like coronary artery disease patients sometimes they're gestures angina it's because they're not getting enough arterial blood flow same thing can happen in the leg so if you have a deep leg pain when you're sitting around doing nothing it shouldn't hurt think about pad it could be ischemic leg pain or leg pain because you're not getting enough arterial blood flow okay the other type of pain to look for in the legs is okay you don't have pain when you're resting but when you walk or maybe go up some stairs then it hurts that's not normal and then you sit down and it goes away that's called intermittent claudication it's pain in the legs that you don't have when you're resting but when you walk and move around it hurts and then you rest again and it goes away think about the close cousin of peripheral arterial disease coronary disease maybe a gentleman is 50s maybe overweight diabetic he doesn't really have chest pain but then he goes and shovels the snow from his driveway and then he gets chest pain then he goes and rests and it goes away it's the same principle this same gentleman may not have pain in his legs but when he goes and shovels the snow from the driveway or tries to mow the lawn his legs will start hurting and then he'll have to rest these are telltale signs of pad so the two big signs and symptoms to look for wounds ankles leg and feet that are slow to heal or don't heal and two leg pain without any other obvious cause obviously if you just sprained your ankle and your leg hurts well that's the cause if you've had leg pain or you have leg pain at rest or on activity that is alleviated by rest think pad give us a call have your referring physician send us let us evaluate your leg arteries those are the two big wounds and or leg pain there are some secondary signs i'll just list them quickly because in and of themselves they may not necessarily indicate pid but there's secondary signs hair loss inexplicable hair loss on the legs shiny skin we've seen this many times discoloration of the skin purplish reddish breakdown dry skin these are all secondary signs but really look for the two big ones wounds and or leg pain if you have either one of these or both of these call us have your referring physician refer you to us and let us evaluate	High Medical Info

of them have type 2 diabetes some of those are testing their blood sugar at home but the best research is telling us that they don't need do that in fact it's a waste of money it's not a small problem the waste is running into the billions of dollars and it's costing all of us money through the healthcare system that's the topic of this week's healthcare triage for people with type 1 diabetes blood glucose monitoring and insulin administration is the standard of care patients need to check their blood sugar multiple times a day then give themselves insulin to replace what would have been made in the pancreas treatment for type 2 diabetes however doesn't involve these critical calculations of insulin it's usually maintained with pretty regular administration of the same drugs on a set schedule self-monitoring for blood glucose therefore may be unnecessary for those not on insulin this has been tested in well-designed studies the monitor trial published two years ago in JAMA internal medicine was a pragmatic trial that took place in 15 primary care practices in North Carolina patients with type 2 non insulin treated diabetes were randomly assigned to one of three groups people in the first group were told to check their blood glucose once a day people in the second were told to check their blood glucose once a day and then they were given tailored advice depending on the results from the meter the third group was told not to check their blood sugar at all after one year which is a pretty impressive length for a study like this there were no differences in the hemoglobin a1c levels which is the best way to monitor long-term blood glucose control between the three groups there were also no differences in the health-related quality of life measures for the patients there were no differences in the number of times they experience hypoglycemia how much care they needed and how many progressed to the need for insulin in other words there were no measurable differences in how patients fared whether they check blood sugar or not this evidence while the best to date confirm what previous work had shown a 2012 Cochrane review assessed all the randomized controlled trials through 2011 that had investigated how testing for blood glucose at home improved outcomes it included 12 trials involving more than 3200 patients by 12 months the overall benefit to testing with respect to lab values was statistically insignificant there were never any benefits with respect to patient satisfaction still not everyone is on board critics of this most recent trial said it didn't prove that blood glucose monitoring couldn't help it's possible to with better training or more attention to detail there might be ways to make it work the point of pragmatic comparative effectiveness trials though which we've covered in previous episodes is to test how practices work in the real world in these high-quality primary care practices even with customized help in interpreting the measurements which is more than most patients get testing blood sugar didn't make a difference choosing wisely we've covered it before is an educational campaign aiming to reduce unnecessary medical tests and procedures and it advises against routine home glucose monitoring for patients with type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin it says that there is no benefit admit there are potential harms like an association with increased anxiety this argument is supported by the American Academy of Family Physicians the Society of general internal medicine and The Endocrine Society of course there are exceptions when patients are acutely ill or changing regimens or finding that their blood sugar is not well controlled testing may be appropriate such decisions should be made in consultation with a physician but for most people with type 2 diabetes not an insulin testing is inappropriate most of the time that message is not getting through at the end of last year another study was published in JAMA internal medicine that quantified the prevalence of glucose testing and adults researchers examined a database that contain data on more than three hundred and seventy thousand commercial health insurance and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries who had type 2 diabetes of the more than 23 percent of patients who were using testing strips more than half were probably doing so in spite of widespread recommendations that they should not they were using a median of two testing strips a day at a cost of more than three hundred and twenty-five dollars per year per patient on another front the New York Times and other places have reported that a surprisingly large number of people who use insulin are using less because they can't afford it putting themselves in danger with a healthcare system as complicated as ours it's hard to take money from one pot and shifted easily to another efficiency and each system is crucial the fact that a necessary facet of diabetes care is increasingly out of reach while unnecessary and potentially harmful care is easily overused illustrates how much work still needs to be done hey Edie I like the show it really helps

Reath, MD	1036931.0	"Hi everybody. I'm Dr. David Reath. And I'm going to talk about this week's Truth-O-MeterTuesday question. The topic this week is BMI, or Body Mass Index. Body Mass Index is a calculation that is madeon the basis of your height and weight that will categorize you in terms of where youare with your weight. Either being underweight, at an ideal weight,overweight, or significantly overweight--or obese. Now we use this as a guide for who is a goodcandidate for body contouring surgery because body contouring surgery is not weight losssurgery. So the question we asked is this: You needto have a Body Mass Index of 30 or less to be a good candidate for a tummy tuck or abdomiplasty. And the answer is True. This is perhaps my preference, but I thinkit's a good general guideline, that you should be at a reasonable weight prior to body contouringsurgery and I use a Body Mass Index of 30 as a cut off. Sometimes there's some wiggle room in there,but the reason I do this is because the results of the procedures are betterand they are safer if you are at a better, more healthy weight. And so we use Body Mass Index as a guideline. Now many people say, ""Well how do I know whatmy Body Mass Index is?"" That's a very good question. We put on our web page a calculator whereyou put in your height and your weight and it will show you what your Body Mass Indexis. And it also gives you the guidelines of whereyou want to be. So if you're wondering what your Body MassIndex is, go to our website, click on the page for the Tummy Tuck, and you'll find itthere. But let's find out who won this week. Kimberly Shanks. Kimberly, you're this week's winner. Congratulations. You get our $100 gift card. Please come to the office and pick that up. We'll find some good things for you to getwith that. And for everybody else, thanks for playingand I will talk to you again next week."	High Medical Info

[¬†__¬†] [¬†__¬†] will work this time [¬†__¬†] right when I get [¬†__¬†] ready to explode it's [¬†__¬†] up my stupid technologies [¬†__¬†] okay so we're gonna start off the talk tonight by talking about tight [¬†__¬†] one diabetes type one diabetes okay type two diabetes is a [¬†__¬†] joke just shut the [¬†__¬†] up and stop eating type one's different it's more critical if it's [¬†__¬†] actually type one so today I [¬†__¬†] cured type one diabetes and 24 [¬†__¬†] hours how did I do this well for starters it was a [¬†__¬†] piss poor [¬†__¬†] diagnosis from a [¬†__¬†] idiot doctor so the story is what happened is this the girl I was coaching went through some trauma this is a lot of times how people become type one diabetes diabetics because they end up developing an autoimmune issue because they went through some [¬†__¬†] hardcore trauma maybe not super [¬†__¬†] sick okay this girl got burnt okay that's how it starts there's very few [¬†__¬†] natural type 1 diabetics in the world k it's the [¬†__¬†] epidemic that the doctors are creating you're not [¬†__¬†] born whether you could have [¬†__¬†] beat it at one point just it goes on so long and they [¬†__¬†] it up so bad with insulin that you pretty much can get right [¬†__¬†] okay so here's how I coach people this girl I start coaching her okay what we did basically we started fasting and I got her to eat one [¬†__¬†] meal at night carbs okay I've done the [¬†__¬†] keto routine before it [¬†__¬†] is [¬†__¬†] kids not one good reason you keto macros anymore I don't promote keto macros everybody promote [¬†__¬†] fasting anything [¬†__¬†] roots and [¬†__¬†] fruit potatoes and steak okay but anyway this girl I got her to eat one [¬†__¬†] meal when you're trying to [¬†__¬†] beat type 1 diabetes or trying to get him in the groove of living this lifestyle yeah got it keep it [¬†__¬†] consistent so one [¬†__¬†] meal they are like 300 grams of [¬†__¬†] meat and carrots like a few hundred grams and some [¬†__¬†] berries ok and then we wait so we wait so we're [¬†__¬†] blood sugar was fine before we ate ok then she ate the meal this is today she hadn't took in any insulin yet any her [¬†__¬†] blood sugar [¬†__¬†] spiked up to 12 after she ate but we didn't panic cuz a [¬†__¬†] high blood sugar temporarily is [¬†__¬†] off ain't gonna die it's a low Florida boat the [¬†__¬†] lows not the [¬†__¬†] high blood sugar temporarily so we [¬†__¬†] waited and guess what her [¬†__¬†] blood sugar after two hours popped down to eight and I'm like don't [¬†__¬†] touch that insulin yet let's [¬†__¬†] wait you got two hours before we're gonna go to bed she went to bed and her blood sugar was down to 6 by itself ok we ain't a [¬†__¬†] meal full of carbs her [¬†__¬†] blood sugar spiked we were [¬†__¬†] patient and it dropped no the problem would happen she got burnt and over the last two years he developed an autoimmune issue and that's what [¬†__¬†] up it was a hormone issue the [¬†__¬†] up her insulin production and then finally one day she ended up in the hospital because she had high blood sugar okay and then the [¬†__¬†] dumb doctors just [¬†__¬†] diagnosed her with [¬†__¬†] type 1 diabetes and put her on [¬†__¬†] insulin luckily this is only two weeks ago so then she got ahold of me so her body's not [¬†__¬†] up yet you see when they put you on [¬†__¬†] insulin when you don't need to be on [¬†__¬†] insulin if you just faster to fix the [¬†__¬†] autoimmune problem at the start then your [¬†__¬†] pancreas wouldn't quit producing it it's just like testosterone you know juiceheads [¬†__¬†] pound testosterone and then their balls don't produce any same thing that's what the [¬†__¬†] stupid goddamn [¬†__¬†] mainstream doctors do insulin insulin insulin let's just put everybody on [¬†__¬†] insulin that's all we did as I got her to [¬†__¬†] fast she ate she [¬†__¬†] waited and the sugar came down and it's gonna just get better and better and better pretty soon or [¬†__¬†] insulin is gonna be [¬†__¬†] pumping in someone she [¬†__¬†] eats any carbs and the reason like I said I don't know [¬†__¬†] stupid [¬†__¬†] keto macros or anything anymore because you know what they feel like [¬†__¬†] I [¬†__¬†] coach type ones before tried to go keto macros and it [¬†__¬†] made them feel like [¬†__¬†] [¬†__¬†] you're fasting ok we're [¬†__¬†] fasting don't control your weight loss of keto mackerels fast the [¬†__¬†] fat off refeed with some carbs that's fine carbs aren't bad cakes bad breads junk I'm talking [¬†__¬†] real clean carbs get fruit and [¬†__¬†] roots get [¬†__¬†] leafy greens and [¬†__¬†] stems are way overrated [¬†__¬†] have a lot of that on my old [¬†__¬†] youtubes because I used to [¬†__¬†] push Kido Kido [¬†__¬†] he [¬†__¬†] makes you flat and and [¬†__¬†] can't build muscle with his [¬†__¬†] it's junk ok so that's how we did it simple soy you type once you want to start fasting you [¬†__¬†] gotta watch your guard down blood sugar okay you're [¬†__¬†] fast all [¬†__¬†] day keep an eye on your blood sugar can't eat a meal and then watch your [¬†__¬†] blood sugar and don't just hammer your insulin so quick cuz you're you you don't need nearly as much you end up cutting the insulin back to like [¬†__¬†] off now not everybody's going to have a result like this girl did in 24 hours but if you stick to a routine I have type ones that are fasting 48 hours at a time now and that is how you wake your [¬†__¬†] pancreas back up and get [¬†__¬†] beta cells producing again making insulin you gotta give it a rest and you insulin-dependent tight tunes you're just [¬†__¬†] fat pigs stop [¬†__¬†] eating because what you did is you went into the doctor and now your liver is so [¬†__¬†] that the metformin doesn't even work so now it's like well let's pound e-poll insulin and then what they do is they systematically turn you into a type 1 just like they would have systematically turned this girl into a [¬†__¬†] permanent type 1 if she wouldn't have met me and we go to [¬†__¬†] did some fasting got her up [¬†__¬†] insulin [¬†__¬†] man most of the type ones can still be reversed if you have diagnosed recently can be off that insulin in no time flat saving yourself nothing but money and not [¬†__¬†] your body even people that have been [¬†__¬†] on the insulin for a few years if you start fasting and you're consistent you can reverse type 1 diabetes the people that have been [¬†__¬†] up since they were 4 years old because maybe they got meningitis or something shock their system now their type once if you give it enough [¬†__¬†] time the body is resilient as [¬†__¬†] and the body will start producing insulin again if your [¬†__¬†] fasting and your [¬†__¬†] getting the insulin out of your life that you're injecting the only way you can do that it's not [¬†__¬†] eating some of these [¬†__¬†] goddamn type ones they're like well I like these like shut the [¬†__¬†] up you like to eat if you like to be fat and [¬†__¬†] sick you idiot [¬†__¬†] that's all you got to do you got to pay attention to what you do start with a meal and a routine some carbs [¬†__¬†] keep your insulin at bay okay you'll need very small amounts learn how to [¬†__¬†] dilute the insulin get half-unit injectors because you'll need like [¬†__¬†] all all the insulin you're taking now will cut down to like a [¬†__¬†] fifth okay and that's it consistency is [¬†__¬†] key with [¬†__¬†] type 1 diabetes that's all you got to do that's it it's so [¬†__¬†] easy and you drink snake juice all day as much as you want I don't [¬†__¬†] care as much snake juice as you want do not let yourself get [¬†__¬†] dehydrated if you're a type 1 cattle carry you mix up to two liters of snake juice ok recipe as usual one teaspoon of potassium chloride half a teaspoon of [¬†__¬†] Himalayan pink salt one teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon of magnesium sulfate which is [¬†__¬†] optional so you need the three things and when you run out of that 2 litres you mix up another batch and you start drinking it again no fresh water snake juice and that's it you drink it and drink it and drink it and eat a meal a day and dial it in and if you [¬†__¬†] see that your blood Sugar's staying nice and low perfect fast longer try a 48 see this is what people [¬†__¬†] up it's like they're trying to they're so worried about the high blood sugar the high blood sugar temporarily it's not gonna kill you solos it'll [¬†__¬†] kill you your type 1 and then the [¬†__¬†] tight twos they're always worried about the high blood sugar - ok relax fast let your blood [¬†__¬†] clear and your [¬†__¬†] fine if you're tight to worry about [¬†__¬†] control unep it drops under because obviously you're [¬†__¬†] up and you could get a little low on blood sugar maybe that rarely happens with the tight Tuesday coach but if it does then you [¬†__¬†] ever [¬†__¬†] quit snack bring it back up don't [¬†__¬†] control it on the top and with your [¬†__¬†] stupid metformin because you can't stop eating control it on the [¬†__¬†] bottom and give your [¬†__¬†] body a rest stop pumping it full of [¬†__¬†] meds and insulin [¬†__¬†] that's it it's nothing it's science pure [¬†__¬†] you can consistent meal a day drink lots of [¬†__¬†] snake juice [¬†__¬†] watch a [¬†__¬†] blood sugar try to dial it in get half units [¬†__¬†] figure to dilute your [¬†__¬†] insulin don't you slow acting insulin either it's [¬†__¬†] it'll [¬†__¬†] make you have lows all you need to do is eat your meal get your [¬†__¬†] blood sugar down to a nice [¬†__¬†] low number before a bad time and go to that don't use the slow-acting [¬†__¬†] it'll [¬†__¬†] you up and they'll make you have a low and then if you have a low we got to eat and that's exactly we don't want to do is have to [¬†__¬†] eat KL announcer some [¬†__¬†] questions I'm gonna be looking for diabetes questions here a lot - okay let's see here somebody asked about finding the [¬†__¬†] potassium chloride [¬†__¬†] look harder sick of [¬†__¬†] answering that question go on the internet [¬†__¬†] get it in bulk in bags there's all sorts of places potassium chloride powder somebody asks what about type-2 alcoholic same [¬†__¬†] [¬†__¬†] up liver start [¬†__¬†] fasting that's it stop [¬†__¬†] eating and start [¬†__¬†] fasting when you're tight too tight to is nothing it's nothing if you're tight to you're [¬†__¬†] drunk or a fat pink that's it or you [¬†__¬†] your liver with [¬†__¬†] meds like Tylenol and [¬†__¬†] fast okay the only once a critical type one somebody that actually doesn't make insulin see this is how I knew this girl was not even [¬†__¬†] this is how I knew they'd [¬†__¬†] badly diagnosed her because her blood sugar was dropping in the morning with exercise like crazy it won't drop like that when you're type 1 it'll always climb anybody that wasn't really that it was a long time type 1 and really [¬†__¬†] up my coach the blood sugar will climb it will [¬†__¬†] drop like a rock like that that's how I knew [¬†__¬†] [¬†__¬†] her oh my god everyone's always like that didn't see the doctors a lot of them mean well and a lot of them aren't smart IQ wise but they're so brainwashed and they have sex big egos they're only as smart as the system they got their education from and the education system is [¬†__¬†] corrupt and fought King the doctors are only as smart as their education and their education is crap crap Claudia San Diego says I hope to fix my insulin resistance and lose the fat simple to get more insulin sensitive you have [¬†__¬†] fast tight twos or it's a joke so he gets a [¬†__¬†] joke she fast juice nothing it's nothing okay Lynnae just donated me 50 bucks thank you let's see here CR says you're awesome cool can I lose 90 pounds in two months and cure diabetes between dry fast and snake fasting what's a good regime to follow Peter type to [¬†__¬†] and dry faster balls off if you're type 1 do gave your tight [¬†__¬†] one-drink piles of snakejuice and do what i said start with a meal a day routine don't try to do a long fast right not bad until you have full confidence in your [¬†__¬†] routine checking your [¬†__¬†] sugars okay EB K keys ass workout routine for a lean fasting type one diabetic there's a million training routines out there go [¬†__¬†] figure it out kay I'm gonna have a fella who's gonna be like my designated online [¬†__¬†] strength and conditioning coach and you're gonna find out who he is he's actually doing a transformation for me and as I don't have time to [¬†__¬†] be giving out workout plans go on the [¬†__¬†] internet find them they're all over the place okay okay like my niece is [¬†__¬†] health and fat loss okay go [¬†__¬†] find your training routine but now as far as you being a type-1 like I said optimally you just eat at night eat like three hours before bed eat [¬†__¬†] you can eat carbs okay eat [¬†__¬†] steak and sweet potatoes then take your fast-acting stuff dial your blood sugar down to where it gets nice gonna be nice to get it down around five or less okay millimoles per liter then go to bed and then the next day go to the [¬†__¬†] gym and optimally if you're actually a type 1 your sugar will climb and then you might get up a little high where you have to take a little shot insulin in midday you shouldn't have to eat food if you have to eat food you [¬†__¬†] up if you're a type 1 and you put yourself in a situation where you had to eat to bring up your blood sugar you [¬†__¬†] up with your insulin I can't say it any [¬†__¬†] more simple than that okay you [¬†__¬†] up with your insulin if you [¬†__¬†] have to eat when you shouldn't be eating okay Tiffany ass is normal to not lose weight during a period yeah like it's water take [¬†__¬†] measurements you know how often you'll hold water like crazy and I lose any [¬†__¬†] weight but your body's just shrinking it's like you're just drinking cake [¬†__¬†] goddamn measurements take everything log everything sunset effect asked can I just stick with back-to-back 72s on snake juice since I'm comfortable with that the top is use occurring or should I try to bump it up to five or seven days fast and pretty tired by our 72 fast as long as you can okay I'll tell you right now if you're doing straight 72 s with a little chicken [¬†__¬†] refeed [¬†__¬†] you're gonna get good results I'm not gonna [¬†__¬†] cuss you out for doing 70 [¬†__¬†] twos all the time okay but go as long as you can but 72 is that's a good [¬†__¬†] fast especially if you eat small at the end of it you're gonna [¬†__¬†] get results from that there's no doubt about it in fact other that she did some long fast but Samantha that lost 200 pounds in a year she did it lots of 72s so long as the reef feeds are small okay let's see here yeah here's another one inch we dot-com said my husband sugars went from 11 to 4 and a half in like four days no pills from [¬†__¬†] doctors exactly like type 2 the joke soon as your [¬†__¬†] blood sugar clears you haven't reversed the type 2 though yet understand that you start fasting sugars will drop down to where they should be but you haven't reversed anything yet you know you've reversed it when you can handle a [¬†__¬†] sugar load and your body will recover without drugs or Mads that's why the girl today we ate a meal no insulin she recovered from it ok if you're tight [¬†__¬†] 2 if you can eat some carbs and the blood sugar will go high if it recover it's on if it recovers on its own you're good if you're really healthy like me I can eat a bucket of [¬†__¬†] ice cream and [¬†__¬†] down my blood sugar up to like 11 and it'll be back down to 4 and a half and a half an hour that's healthy when your [¬†__¬†] blood sugar when you're that insulin sensitive your blood and your livers that good then your blood starting to be up till 11:00 ciao a pile of sugar and recover back down to four and a half that's where you want to be okay chris farley donating me 20 bucks says he's on day 8 of a fast awesome Seth Hershiser asks why does your and fast and cause diarrhea sometimes it will have to start because you're detoxing like crazy okay that's the main thing because when I [¬†__¬†] did four days I went four days and I went dry drank a pile of piss at night and I [¬†__¬†] got the shits like the first night or the second night and then I was flying out for that okay your boys you're gonna clear all the [¬†__¬†] out of your pipes and you'll be fine like I saved your fat dirty Pig you gotta [¬†__¬†] lose weight and get clean fat people are dirty you gotta lose all the weight and get lean and clean you're never clean it when you're fat you never [¬†__¬†] clean when your fat ass now if you got lean and you gained weight back with a clean [¬†__¬†] diet and a fasting regiment no dirty [¬†__¬†] food you could technically be a little bit fat and [¬†__¬†] clean but you're not [¬†__¬†] clean everyone's dirty as [¬†__¬†] okay let's see here here's one the social media guy says what if your high blood pressure keeps going up and down throughout the day on the fast how does one know one that will finally stabilize at the fast well watch it then if it's sky-high just and your goddamn blood pressure med till the [¬†__¬†] blood pressure drops down low then cut the Med okay it's like it's just systemic okay you gotta be methodical with this [¬†__¬†] this is the beauty about fasting you can be so consistent with your [¬†__¬†] routine then if you do the same thing every day it's impossible to [¬†__¬†] it up I learned this when I was working [¬†__¬†] in the patch okay you keep things simple like three different fun refeeds once you're lean if you're trying to figure [¬†__¬†] out specially the type ones eat the same [¬†__¬†] thing every day the same amounts the same [¬†__¬†] three different foods a meat like I usually get people just eat some sort of a meat source same weight [¬†__¬†] carrots and maybe some berries and that's it that is it for like two weeks [¬†__¬†] straight until we get a goddamn pattern I need to see a pattern I can't [¬†__¬†] troubleshoot [¬†__¬†] all when people are mixing and matching all the time and not quitting their meds and all this other [¬†__¬†] it's all about patterns to figure the [¬†__¬†] out okay there's one Britney case says fasting on snake juice with zero refeeds rate days and feel amazing but I had an IUD for two years and haven't had a period since then I'm spotting every day since the fast well this eventually stopped ah once you I mean I've had all sorts of experiences [¬†__¬†] I had a woman I had a woman you told me the other day and her mom is having her period again and she's like [¬†__¬†] it she's in menopause for the last ten years she started fast that you're knocking back borax now she's having her [¬†__¬†] period again okay until you're leaving and clean and your hormones are balanced all sorts of [¬†__¬†] [¬†__¬†] will happen I say this [¬†__¬†] million times okay you're not gonna die so what you're spotting who [¬†__¬†] cares keep [¬†__¬†] fasting you're not gonna die you're not gonna [¬†__¬†] die Abner s been can't pronounce this [¬†__¬†] name can fasting care bone issues like osteoporosis you [¬†__¬†] bat like it mobilizes minerals and especially if you're knocking down borax like borax basically is sodium tetraborate the cure for osteoporosis bones you name it okay fasting and like [¬†__¬†] all that [¬†__¬†] and calcium is [¬†__¬†] junk the [¬†__¬†] places with the highest calcium intake or the ones with the most osteoporosis or most hip fractures okay Kel seems as [¬†__¬†] scam um let's see here sunshine j-bird asks i love veggies eat so much still constipated so scrap the [¬†__¬†] veggies need [¬†__¬†] some [¬†__¬†] berries I don't even promote vegetables anymore and buy vegetable I mean leaves and stems okay I promote [¬†__¬†] fruit and roots on [¬†__¬†] that's like [¬†__¬†] anytime if I eat like [¬†__¬†] okay kales junk go to your [¬†__¬†] research [¬†__¬†] earth I'm the anti nutrients in this [¬†__¬†] doesn't matter how much nutrients is in it if it poisons you to [¬†__¬†] eat it okay it was it was an evolve to keep bugs off it okay leaves and Sam's we [¬†__¬†] her junk Gaelic kids won't eat that [¬†__¬†] because it's junk okay and it's even from a [¬†__¬†] evolutionary stand but there's no calories and [¬†__¬†] greens there's no calories why the [¬†__¬†] would a caveman want to eat food with his no [¬†__¬†] calories okay they want eat [¬†__¬†] calorically dense foods that's why everyone gets so hooked on a lot of these [¬†__¬†] low-calorie [¬†__¬†] vegetables so everyone's a bunch of fat [¬†__¬†] fat asses okay that's not were meant to eat we're meant to [¬†__¬†] fast and then eat those good weight figure it out if it feels good and you're fasting but fry [¬†__¬†] don't just [¬†__¬†] be brainwashed into one thing cake be consistent and then try some different [¬†__¬†] because end of the day if you feel good you're fine and the reason I want to hit this topic up is because I got people hit me off about blood tests and [¬†__¬†] and it's like do you feel good and they're like they might have something that's out of the [¬†__¬†] mainstream range in their blood test and I'm like how do you feel versus a week ago they're like amazing well then shut the [¬†__¬†] up and keep doing when you're [¬†__¬†] doing okay people just get so bought in to the [¬†__¬†] goddamn blood test all this [¬†__¬†] if you feel better than you did before you're going in the right [¬†__¬†] direction [¬†__¬†] people like it's like they don't even care if they feel like [¬†__¬†] it's like they'd rather feel like [¬†__¬†] and have [¬†__¬†] so-called good blood tests then [¬†__¬†] feel good and [¬†__¬†] because here's the thing cholesterol and [¬†__¬†] some of the numbers like the free fatty acids blood lipids and [¬†__¬†] are gonna be high when you're breaking down body found like a [¬†__¬†] when you're fasting so what so what cholesterol is not even a health marker for fucksakes cholesterol don't mean [¬†__¬†] people they all anti-cholesterol so who cares it's the inflammation all the [¬†__¬†] goddamn sugar processed sugars it [¬†__¬†] you KN cholesterol calcium just come along to heal the arteries after you already [¬†__¬†] him up from all the information from your [¬†__¬†] from not fasting having high insulin all the time suppose you're [¬†__¬†] diabetic in a pound in insulin you want to talk about information that hardens your arteries that [¬†__¬†] you [¬†__¬†] kills you anything you've ever been taught like you start going down this rabbit hole like I have you'll [¬†__¬†] see that everything is a lie everything everything is a [¬†__¬†] lie it's like exact opposite of what you [¬†__¬†] were taught it's [¬†__¬†] just to make other people's agendas to make [¬†__¬†] money okay here's one Lisa says as the type one diabetic we are told to have no ketones that's [¬†__¬†] that's another thing from what I've listened to of your videos we want higher ketones during the fast correct okay this is the one thing that's why I told you a meal a day with carbs cuz yeah I don't want you don't have to [¬†__¬†] be [¬†__¬†] super high on ketones like you don't have to be crazy ketosis when you're a type one plus you're gonna burn more body fat as a type one anyway because your body almost thinks it's actually in starvation mode before it really is the way the liver works in the way because your body thinks it's starving because the insulin can't put any [¬†__¬†] car but if there's no insulin there's no carbs going into your liver sort of like you'll actually get in ketosis quicker as a type 1 it's okay to show ketones okay but you got to make sure you're drinking lots of water because a bad combination is when you have high blood sugar and crazy high ketones and you're dehydrated that's when ketoacidosis happens the only time you can get ketoacidosis it's not ketosis ketoacidosis is different talking type ones none of you [¬†__¬†] are gonna get ketoacidosis except a type one that [¬†__¬†] up the only time it'll happen is if you're [¬†__¬†] crazy dehydrated okay you gotta be crazy dehydrated for it to happen and your blood Sugar's gonna be through the [¬†__¬†] roof for way too long that's what happens okay you'll be fine if you stick to a [¬†__¬†] meal carb and [¬†__¬†] dial in your routine with your [¬†__¬†] insulin and then see how and CLU if you get better and better you lead less and less and less [¬†__¬†] insulin its that's Paul okay yeah so somebody said right here so my old [¬†__¬†] okay used to always say [¬†__¬†] on your [¬†__¬†] refeeds [¬†__¬†] keep the carbs at a minimum okay but the problem was after a while I realized that people had fucked-up bowel movements because keto is [¬†__¬†] if you're gonna go low-carb eat low carb fruit people always think fruit is sweet tomatoes are [¬†__¬†] not sweet can't even get [¬†__¬†] squash all sorts of [¬†__¬†] okay you know need leaves and stems low carbs okay but when I used to say vegetables like that was kind of a broad [¬†__¬†] statement because the real a lot of things are fruit like [¬†__¬†] like zucchinis and shits all fruit okay the main thing is fast as long as you can as long as you [¬†__¬†] can and then you can refeed unfuckin whatever you want just don't get plugged up okay and keep the carbs at a minimum if you're trying to lose weight but you don't want to get constipated that's it okay don't really give a [¬†__¬†] what the [¬†__¬†] you eat when you're a fat ass fast as long as you can because once you get lean the true colors of your [¬†__¬†] actual macros will show it will show up Rebecca Rebecca is B said type one for children Tina's teenagers this work for them it's gonna work for everybody one thing though good point when their children guess what the one unit fast-acting insulin is way too much go on YouTube and [¬†__¬†] what's his name doctor not the Bernstein [¬†__¬†] [¬†__¬†] doctor so there's this one night then he talks about diluting the insulin because little kids need so much less they need like way less than a unit like not even close and you get this insulin diluting fluid and you that's how they control it because the kids are always yo-yoing because they have weight they don't either eat a pile of sugar like and then hit the insulin they're always going back and forth it's no good cuz the insolence to stance can you go to dilute that [¬†__¬†] so that's how it works it's the same laws everybody else this guy asks how to avoid constipation like I said you'll never ever ever get constipated if your refeeding on [¬†__¬†] goddamn fruit and [¬†__¬†] roots that's where I went like [¬†__¬†] there's not one good use for keto anymore keno is a [¬†__¬†] Aikido macro routine is a [¬†__¬†] therapeutical diet that was basically made up to help to control epileptics but they just needed to fast okay you get everything out of fasting then you get on a [¬†__¬†] eating keto without the [¬†__¬†] [¬†__¬†] food choices we're never ever ever ever ever meant to eat straight [¬†__¬†] Kido we're meant to [¬†__¬†] fast and eat [¬†__¬†] whatever it was there for fruit and [¬†__¬†] roots and [¬†__¬†] that's what we were meant to do we're never meant eat [¬†__¬†] strict [¬†__¬†] Keadle all day long or even in your stupid 816 fasting window like one of the best what's your rift and lean one of the best [¬†__¬†] meals to try to start is going to be steak and potatoes and maybe some berries that's what I'm gonna be eatin [¬†__¬†] fake and [¬†__¬†] sweet potatoes and potatoes and [¬†__¬†] berries because you'll feel strong as [¬†__¬†] your [¬†__¬†] muscle glycogen will be full and you'll be nice and hard full looking and you'll have energy of the ass you won't be able to [¬†__¬†] flat like you get flat on keto your alert and [¬†__¬†] but we're never meant to be in ketosis like that like for all like we're never meant to be in ketosis 24/7 the only reason we [¬†__¬†] do it when we fast cuz you guys [¬†__¬†] aren't in a natural state and all fat but once you get lean we're supposed to go in and out of ketosis on the daily okay like I'm in and out of ketosis all the time like I'll eat tonight and then tomorrow bye like [¬†__¬†] eight hours I'm back in ketosis it's like you're in and out in and out that's all [¬†__¬†] works fasting is number-one priority or not you're [¬†__¬†] stupid Kido macros when you refeeding a tiny [¬†__¬†] meal eat some meat and a bunch of cucumbers that's low carb hey I'm meeting a bunch of squash eats and meeting a bunch of tomatoes if you want to keep it low carb [¬†__¬†] that [¬†__¬†] will plug you up you know what [¬†__¬†] plugs you up [¬†__¬†] leaves leaves [¬†__¬†] leaves ok that's why he people even talked about keto anymore I obviously I've made a switch but that's [¬†__¬†] how it works I'm always learning to coaching people I'll never [¬†__¬†] getting that stupid Eagle mindset where I'm just [¬†__¬†] like this this forever that's not how you get better at something that's not how you get better at coaching people that's just an ego [¬†__¬†] [¬†__¬†] mindset there you go to adapt you got to adapt you got to [¬†__¬†] let your little belief system [¬†__¬†] try something different and something isn't [¬†__¬†] working I never got good results eating keto on a meal a day or even [¬†__¬†] on 48 never I always felt flat flat and [¬†__¬†] weak in the gym when it came to the strength lifts always you [¬†__¬†] faster [¬†__¬†] fat [¬†__¬†] ass off for 30 days lose all the [¬†__¬†] weight then you [¬†__¬†] [¬†__¬†] around with your goddamn meal routine how simple is that also there's a good point Lynnae said just because you aren't taking a [¬†__¬†] doesn't mean you're constipated either like if you're not eating for [¬†__¬†] 10 days in a row there's nothing there you're not gonna take a [¬†__¬†] okay if you're plugged up you'll know it it's like a [¬†__¬†] grind and you actually feel like it's gonna take a [¬†__¬†] okay let's see here so you guys hear that you're fast as long as you [¬†__¬†] candle is the goddamn weight don't worry about [¬†__¬†] keto macros the keto people are bad as the [¬†__¬†] vegans now [¬†__¬†] they're a headache [¬†__¬†] I've you know many guys I've got off keto and they're blown away how they feel now I've had like probably 15 guys in the last week they were eating strict [¬†__¬†] keto on a meal a day like lean guys but their [¬†__¬†] week is [¬†__¬†] when I told them stop eating [¬†__¬†] keto start eating [¬†__¬†] meat and potatoes and you watch what happens in the gym and they just [¬†__¬†] blew him away their sleep got better everything up [¬†__¬†] bad as soon as they started eating [¬†__¬†] carbs again strict [¬†__¬†] keto is [¬†__¬†] [¬†__¬†] that is not even close to optimal these keto people are just as bad because you know why it not even fast hard enough the [¬†__¬†] fasting we're still in ketosis all the time doesn't just because you're eating carbs does mean you're in ketosis [¬†__¬†] you're in deeper ketosis when you're fasting even though even when you're eating carbs versus a [¬†__¬†] keto eater if you're doing like if you're eating on 48 if you're eating a small card meal on 48 say you're pretty lean [¬†__¬†] your deep ketosis for 36 hours at least 24 when your strips are [¬†__¬†] black you're so [¬†__¬†] and that's after you ate carbs once your livers working properly you fat asses won't get that result once your [¬†__¬†] lean that's what happens you get in ketosis very quick very quick when you fast shiva asked cool can I jack off while fasting what about sex jerking off [¬†__¬†] week and it just destroys your [¬†__¬†] Drive so does porn speaking of which I can't believe how many women are getting to holding me that are addicted to porn [¬†__¬†] I knew it was bad but it's worse I think it's just as bad for women as it is man like this one girl is telling me that she literally just hangs out at home all day and [¬†__¬†] rubs her [¬†__¬†] I'm like holy [¬†__¬†] she's fat because he [¬†__¬†] just basically masturbates and eats I'm like [¬†__¬†] man [¬†__¬†] porn is the worst it just is see it goes out and out of fat loss porn addicts or fat [¬†__¬†] pigs because they're always watching porn and they don't want to do anything because once you [¬†__¬†] jerk off as a guy I don't want to do nothing the manual just donated me 20 bucks thanks okay stop don't don't start asking me a bunch of questions about [¬†__¬†] food as I said you can have carbs on your [¬†__¬†] refeeds figure it out I'm not a [¬†__¬†] I'm not gonna get your [¬†__¬†] food course to do your fast as long as you can lose the [¬†__¬†] weight and you have a refeed about this [¬†__¬†] big and you can have carbs in it okay that's all I meant I don't need to [¬†__¬†] that see old can I have this can I have this shut the [¬†__¬†] up and fast oh man here's one George Roy hill can you talk about how fasting is going to do demonize gonna be demonized by the media and medical industry because there's no money to made of it well guess what why I'm [¬†__¬†] smarter than the average bear why do you think I [¬†__¬†] use weight losses the driver C soon as you [¬†__¬†] heard Lucy soon as that's a coming from a weight loss angle [¬†__¬†] it goes [¬†__¬†] viral doesn't matter what it is that goes [¬†__¬†] viral okay I've been [¬†__¬†] planning this [¬†__¬†] for two years I was gonna do this when I knew how much health you could get on the fasting because back then I knew fasting could cure cancer but I couldn't just go be like ol to somebody who has cancer that's fat let's say you got a fat ass with cancer back then I couldn't be like oh start fasting to cure your cancer there'll be like man but then if I'm like start fasting to lose a hundred pounds in two months literally be like yeah and guess what end up carrying the cancer the same [¬†__¬†] time cuz they don't give a [¬†__¬†] about their health they just want to [¬†__¬†] lose goddamn weight sadly that's how people think and that's why I always taking it a fat loss angle crazy [¬†__¬†] weight loss results with some of these health benefits of fasting and like basically some of these I guess you could say these protocols that have so many other health benefits worked so well for weight loss so you takin out the weight loss angle and everybody's doing it okay same on the keto diet you think you think people beating keto if they [¬†__¬†] didn't think it would look good for weight loss [¬†__¬†] no not a chance how do you think that caught on but now you got guys like me that are promoting fasting long pro-law and fasting that beats the living [¬†__¬†] out and keto all day and then you know you can actually eat carbs again once you're lean okay because [¬†__¬†] keto the therapeutical diet and it's [¬†__¬†] never meant to be done for [¬†__¬†] long periods of time guns will fit don't a me 25 bucks here's another question chocolate my ami asks do you have any meal plans anywhere yeah don't [¬†__¬†] eat that's the meal plan and once you're lean once you're really lean eat a meal every 1 or 2 days and log it and get it on the Fox kale log your body weight and [¬†__¬†] figure out if you're getting stronger in the gym it's so simple don't confuse this [¬†__¬†] you know your meal plan should be once you get [¬†__¬†] lean go to a meal a day or a meal every two days eat X amount of meat keep it exact same eat some [¬†__¬†] potatoes and some berries start there and then once you dial in a meal keep the meal identical for like two weeks and then mix and match foods maybe instead evening berries you throw in [¬†__¬†] a couple apples maybe instead of these sweet potatoes you pull those oats on a different starchy carb that's how you [¬†__¬†] do it systematically okay and boring but it [¬†__¬†] words okay [¬†__¬†] figure it out all you need that for me is the motivation to fast so you don't earn a [¬†__¬†] [¬†__¬†] most people just don't most people just [¬†__¬†] straight-up scared spartak said how much protein do consume for powerlifters on the snake diet well what's your [¬†__¬†] goalie try to lose weight like even try to lose weight fast and get rid of the [¬†__¬†] fat then focus on building muscle cut the fat as quick as you can don't worry about your [¬†__¬†] guard down muscle get lean and then build from a lean point okay are you trying to get lean you're already ripped [¬†__¬†] eat a meal a day and [¬†__¬†] go with a ground per protein gram of protein per pound bodyweight start there okay go by feel in the gym once you're leaning into anything people always ask me how do I maintain this like box same when you [¬†__¬†] lost weight using your lead now you're lean do whatever the [¬†__¬†] you want just don't go back to eating multiple meals a day okay that's it like [¬†__¬†] people complicate [¬†__¬†] so much like I swear to God like people like wanna make it hard it's not easy it's this easy okay let's see here chocolate in Miami will you ever do a full video based on lean people for requirements and issues I [¬†__¬†] down a million I [¬†__¬†] talk about it every time I'm on here like I said you [¬†__¬†] eat a [¬†__¬†] meal at eight how hard is that you're [¬†__¬†] lean ok you're lean eat a [¬†__¬†] meal it in and that one-hour window that's it and continue on the steak juice you might need less salts and you can make up your own snake juice at that point get lots of salt in on the meal that's simple eat [¬†__¬†] one meal a [¬†__¬†] day when you're ripped until your rip your [¬†__¬†] don't eat then just need a [¬†__¬†] meal like figure it out your body you're gonna have to [¬†__¬†] around foods maybe some people don't react good to bananas like maybe they need a [¬†__¬†] okay it's it figure load it's a one meal make your perfect little meal and try it try it for a week see what the scale does see your energy is like if it does if it's not great tweak it change it [¬†__¬†] it's one [¬†__¬†] little meal you got to build it's not like you're eating six [¬†__¬†] meals a day it was a bunch of complex [¬†__¬†] it's one [¬†__¬†] goddamn meal Elias Cedeno asks what if you aren't too lean and want to gain weight what's the best protocol same [¬†__¬†] [¬†__¬†] eat on a meal at a just wide the window if you can eat lots like me [¬†__¬†] I can gain weight eat in one hour but if you can't eat as much as me in an hour then widen it to two hours if you're [¬†__¬†] still can't gain weight widen it through a 3-hour window don't just [¬†__¬†] eat don't ever eat breakfast and then dinner okay eat in a window if you're trying to put on [¬†__¬†] weight okay somebody asks how do we donate if you want to donate you just I don't even know how to do it on here you [¬†__¬†] I don't know even though so with those [¬†__¬†] super chats and I only take donations on here I don't give a [¬†__¬†] but if you want me either if you want to give me a donation you got a [¬†__¬†] joke with me some [¬†__¬†] results I won't even take donations from people that have [¬†__¬†] lost weight doing this have you ever had someone heal scar tissue with fasting yes there's a girl go check out my [¬†__¬†] Instagram snake diet wizard okay there's woman there's one girl my buddy's wife okay she had really bad stretch marks on her stomach they healed up like crazy with dry fasting john doe says can coffee kick yo de ketosis no but coffees [¬†__¬†] trashed [¬†__¬†] system like foxy REM sleep cut it cut coffee it's [¬†__¬†] junk Suzie Cordova ass what about working during fasting what about it do it okay push your comfort zone for [¬†__¬†] sakes [¬†__¬†] you're not gonna die but yeah you might get lightheaded then you know then you know maybe you didn't drink enough snake juice maybe you gotta break your fast push your [¬†__¬†] it comfort zones what do you think I do how do you think I do these [¬†__¬†] experiments when I first started I don't have anybody to turn to I just [¬†__¬†] got like YouTube and Google okay I don't have anybody when I first started drinking piss I don't have anybody that drank it I just did it okay cuz I'm not a [¬†__¬†] [¬†__¬†] this start just start take an hour by hour day by day don't [¬†__¬†] look at the long term so much okay go Bailey feel by the hour push your [¬†__¬†] comfort zone don't be a little [¬†__¬†] just because I'm a little light at it or have a little diarrhea or my [¬†__¬†] my legs are tingling a bit or I have cold hands shut the [¬†__¬†] up that's [¬†__¬†] off like seriously it's like every little symptom shut up [¬†__¬†] just start [¬†__¬†] headache but then can I take [¬†__¬†] Tylenol shut up and [¬†__¬†] start fasting [¬†__¬†] the first [¬†__¬†] 72 or 48 hours will pretty much detox all that [¬†__¬†] out of your body okay if you're [¬†__¬†] gonna work out go to the gym but try it out try the [¬†__¬†] out do [¬†__¬†] god damn 72 hour fast and try going train at the end of the 72 just don't do it for your first fast cuz that's just stupidity because your body's adapting go to the gym at the tail end of a 72 and see if you can perform to feel like [¬†__¬†] go home how hard is that [¬†__¬†] I've done that a million times it's like five coats right button going and training hard on the [¬†__¬†] tail end of a 48 and and I [¬†__¬†] felt good so I [¬†__¬†] kept training hard okay my felt like [¬†__¬†] I just leave [¬†__¬†] don't mean idiot like how hard is that just do it can't say God [¬†__¬†] like [¬†__¬†] just do it everybody's so [¬†__¬†] scared [¬†__¬†] scared scared scared they won't try anything they won't cut meds shut the [¬†__¬†] up and do it even the piss like what do you think I like drinking piss I don't like the taste of pests but I'm so l'√©ducation I'm pissed that I know how good it is for me okay I went down that rabbit hole I found out the [¬†__¬†] truth so now I drink it and now I got a million other people drink and pass [¬†__¬†] I got more people drinking piss than the actual urine therapy groups okay it's honest to god the fastest [¬†__¬†] way you can lose weight is going to be on a dry fasting routine with a [¬†__¬†] piss drinking window which you can't do a snake juice cuz you get the shits but the piss I trust because it's so natural I don't even care if you got the shits from the piss it's like it's like I'm so confident and piss I'll let somebody with [¬†__¬†] that's on heart meds and [¬†__¬†] like [¬†__¬†] an old drink piss but snake juice it's a little more aggressive when you got like some potassium source that you bought from the [¬†__¬†] man in your formula like Oh see piss is so pure natural I trust it and the thing is when you dry fast you're going to be breaking into that metabolic water from burnin so much [¬†__¬†] body fat and then you [¬†__¬†] rehydrate on piss fastest [¬†__¬†] way period you can lose body fat is going to be on a dry fasting block rehydrating on piste and stretching that fast up as long as you can period second fastest way is going to be drinking snake juice all day to lose body fat third fastest way which is technically faster than snake juice but you can't go as long will be just a pure dry fast so essentially we're [¬†__¬†] tricking the system might dry fasting but reap loading on piss and piss takes like no [¬†__¬†] energy to put through your system piss is clean [¬†__¬†] ads [¬†__¬†] clean you know it's funny go look up right now on Google and look up when it says it says the waste products quote-unquote waste products and urine are this guess what they are potassium [¬†__¬†] nitrogen [¬†__¬†] calcium is that waste no [¬†__¬†] that's exactly what's in pickle juice in snake juice because your kidneys [¬†__¬†] regulate they don't [¬†__¬†] clean talk slow to [¬†__¬†] off people gonna wake the [¬†__¬†] up the toxins go at your [¬†__¬†] [¬†__¬†] okay deliberate cleans all the toxins out the piss is clean it's just a regulating system so you don't blow up like if I drank a pile of water and salt right now and I didn't have a [¬†__¬†] regulating system to get rid of it I just explode like that's what your kidneys do they keep you from [¬†__¬†] exploding what do you think people [¬†__¬†] up kidneys get crazy high blood pressure when their kidneys are all [¬†__¬†] up because they've destroyed him a [¬†__¬†] no fasting and high [¬†__¬†] sugar diet their whole life why do you think that makes her blood pressure go up because they can't [¬†__¬†] move any water through the goddamn kidneys okay regulating system even somebody asked what about your pissed of their sediment internet like kidney stones they're clean you could eat kidney stones because all its kidney stones are just minerals okay well it goes back in your stomach the acids just gonna break it down it's not like all those minerals we'll just go back through your kidneys and get lodged [¬†__¬†] people gotta [¬†__¬†] wake up and do some goddamn reading about kidneys work [¬†__¬†] man okay but that's the [¬†__¬†] fastest way piss is unbelievable allergies [¬†__¬†] the antibodies in it unreal okay snake juice works amazing cure everything that way cure everything with dry fasting piss is just next-level [¬†__¬†] I don't drink any water not drink straight [¬†__¬†] piss all the time okay this is funny Amaris said if a doctor told me to drink piss I wouldn't but since Cole did it's different lol day six on piss she says awesome it's serious though it's so harmless it's the perfect electrolyte you can't [¬†__¬†] replace blood they can't copy it it's impossible okay go down that rabbit all like I said everything you've ever been taught is [¬†__¬†] bull [¬†__¬†] there's other agendas at play [¬†__¬†] look at boy rocks [¬†__¬†] me like I said like I had a guy get a hold of me basically started fasting on borax and steak juice his arthritis was gone in two weeks okay like people that [¬†__¬†] grow some balls and try it okay I don't [¬†__¬†] care if you don't want to drink piss but don't be a [¬†__¬†] and just take a drink you can even still put piss in your snake juice because you're gonna get the antibodies like let's say if you [¬†__¬†] had an allergy reaction right now best thing you do is piss in a cup put some in some snake juice and drink it those antibodies will wake up your immune system so [¬†__¬†] quick you'll be theology and [¬†__¬†] a week okay Susie asked what about alcohol it's trash like [¬†__¬†] look look what you're watching this is a [¬†__¬†] goddamn health and fasting channel can't [¬†__¬†] booze as [¬†__¬†] [¬†__¬†] Elco [¬†__¬†] you up it's junk want to talk about toxins everyone's like isn't there toxins in your urine [¬†__¬†] idiots what about all the [¬†__¬†] you eat everything you eats got real toxins in it especially if it's not clean food alcohol is the worst and all the drugs you take and all the tylenol you're on all the [¬†__¬†] everything you put in your body is toxic other than the urine the Hiram's the only thing you're putting back in your bodies actually clean like the bullet that [¬†__¬†] piss is the cleanest thing you can put in your [¬†__¬†] body there's more toxins in your goddamn tap water the only water that would have less toxins than anything is gonna be purely boiled [¬†__¬†] distilled water and it's still not gonna be cleaner than piss because the only thing that's in piss like say if you had a pot test like a [¬†__¬†] drug test there's a minor amounts that they pick up but it's still no more than what's in your blood your urine as always as clean as your [¬†__¬†] blood and your blood is always clean cuz if it was dirty you'd be dead okay let's see here by the way so I have Tammy coming here on Tuesday and we're gonna [¬†__¬†] cure [¬†__¬†] breast cancer I'm [¬†__¬†] try fasting and piss you [¬†__¬†] wait and we got a full documentation full pictures full [¬†__¬†] everything you [¬†__¬†] wait til you see how fast I can [¬†__¬†] cure some serious [¬†__¬†] with [¬†__¬†] piss dry fasting let's call it you [¬†__¬†] we'll call it piss fasting okay your bucket you guys are gonna be blown away at the results all right let's see what other questions we got here another thing is sleep if you [¬†__¬†] some woman that's [¬†__¬†] getting a hold of me and you're bitching about your [¬†__¬†] water weight are you [¬†__¬†] sleeping sleep as soon as you [¬†__¬†] lose your sleep you're gonna [¬†__¬†] stash water like a son of a [¬†__¬†] get it [¬†__¬†] sleep whatever it takes whatever it takes I don't care about your stupid [¬†__¬†] job I don't care about anything cuz you know what a lot of good all that money it made in when your dad at [¬†__¬†] sixty because you didn't get your [¬†__¬†] sleep and you got in your fat at a [¬†__¬†] heart attack because your cortisol is cranked up and your [¬†__¬†] arteries are all hard from all the [¬†__¬†] inflammation okay get your [¬†__¬†] sleep and you'll live to 120 then you got [¬†__¬†] nothing but [¬†__¬†] time to make [¬†__¬†] nice slow [¬†__¬†] money income [¬†__¬†] man people just give away their health for the stupidest [¬†__¬†] things stupidest [¬†__¬†] things the thing is the piss fasting so I took it to a new level because ah let's see this is the problem with the urine therapy people they're not hardcore fasters see like some of them fast but not like me I'm fasting focused so then when you start incorporating DRI fasting in with [¬†__¬†] piss blocking they get ridiculous results like I'm not just looping piss all day cuz here's the thing everyone that thinks that when you're pissed starts to like get really clear that's no good because then there's no minerals the goal is I want my piss to be salty for as many days in a row as I can keep it salty because soon as it gets like really clear that means that you have no minerals in the piston you might as well you're basically doing a [¬†__¬†] plain water fast okay you want it to be salty and the cool part is when you drive fast hard all day you're breaking down all that body fat and the [¬†__¬†] minerals are coming out of that body fat to keep your piss like nice and full of minerals and not just perfectly clean it's actually funny if you can actually make perfectly clean water your body's the best distillation system you've ever found so if you're a pounding the piss and looping it with maybe some distilled water and you started pasting very clean and clear that water is actually pure you can [¬†__¬†] that'll just taste like drinking water your body will make the perfect water it's un-fuckin'-believable if you wanted to somehow stockpile water there was a [¬†__¬†] [¬†__¬†] and vaginas and [¬†__¬†] and dicks Kenny like you could make the cleanest water source and then you could [¬†__¬†] sell it yeah this guy here even said something you have see fighters been drinking piss for years like lyoto machida [¬†__¬†] you drinks piss like [¬†__¬†] crazy okay but it all goes hand in hand weight loss [¬†__¬†] fasting it's just another method of fasting that but I like the pace fasting because I know there's other health benefits that come from it that'll just speed things up okay obviously you get crazy [¬†__¬†] health benefits because you got two things you got a toff a G but you also got auto Genesis auto Genesis when your body rebuilds urines perfect for auto Genesis and then you've got the dry fasting effect when I do my piss dry fasting routine for the crazy etapa G C it's perfect and then my body's getting all the minerals that needs period from the pissed because I'm getting like 2500 [¬†__¬†] minerals they're getting antibodies antigens hormones [¬†__¬†] you're getting proteins okay getting amino acids everything everything let's see here but just to wrap this up so the type ones like I said I got a million messages from type ones now simplest way to do it you don't worry about [¬†__¬†] weight loss of the start okay you make a small meal small amount of meat if it's a woman I would start with like maybe 150 grams of meat simple okay 150 grams of [¬†__¬†] whatever meat you want try to go with something clean and then go with maybe the four to one ratio still but use fruit and roots so what I would use just carrots you can even just go straight carrots you'll meet and carrots keep it's that stupid simple meat and carrots 150 grams meat 600 grams of carrots [¬†__¬†] then eat and then you [¬†__¬†] watch your blood sugar it'll play it'll pop up you [¬†__¬†] take your insulin then you bring it down but understand the very quickly very little insolence so you don't want to give herself a [¬†__¬†] whoa you've got to be [¬†__¬†] patient with taking that insulin very patient then you get your [¬†__¬†] blood sugar down to normal blood sugar go to bed next then you wake up check your blood sugar if it's still decent continue on your day if it starts to creep up during the day by this time you'll know how much insulin will take to bring it down and then you let it get up high enough that you know you're not gonna give yourself a low with one unit and then you [¬†__¬†] take the unit okay you might need more units than one at the start but you gotta figure it out yourself that part I can't [¬†__¬†] babysit you there the protocol though is a meal and a routine fasting all day on snake juice okay drink as much snake juice as you want do not let yourself get dehydrated because that's what could [¬†__¬†] you up as a type-1 it's not like type twos that can [¬†__¬†] drive fast or whatever type ones you need to make sure you're getting in the fluid okay don't let yourself get dehydrated so I'm gonna wrap this up thanks for all the donations so go like my snake diet business page I call it hit like give me a [¬†__¬†] five-star review or once I review I don't get a [¬†__¬†] put something down there subscribe to my youtube channel watch all my newest videos okay the newest ones cuz I contradict the [¬†__¬†] out of myself since the past is that [¬†__¬†] improved and improved and improved but at least my old videos are still motivating as [¬†__¬†] I'm not gonna pull them because they're still correct to a point I just don't promote keto macros at all anymore unless it's a some crazy special situation which I haven't even come across yet because if there's any situation I'd promote keto macros and be with a type 1 diabetic and I don't do it with them so nobody else needs to do it you just need to [¬†__¬†] bastard balls off and then refeed with [¬†__¬†] some sort of a well-rounded meal not leaves and stems ok and snake diet wizard is my Instagram go [¬†__¬†] check all the before and afters are there lots of fat loss stuff ok all the [¬†__¬†] before and afters check it out read the [¬†__¬†] things read the descriptions the people that those pictures are those are by the people that are in the pictures those are written by the people the real world transformations not fake [¬†__¬†] ok also hit the little bell on this so you get notified when I do these lives okay and put your [¬†__¬†] fat [¬†__¬†] ass [¬†__¬†] pictures up on my motivation group

back don't take selfies Kate get somebody to take the [¬†__¬†] pictures from your good quality you'll lose a bunch of weight the weight loss happens fast people take the [¬†__¬†] pictures cuz you'll be pissed when you don't those pictures can change your whole life k already the first fat woman I'll tell you right now the first fat [¬†__¬†] woman that gets fasting her ass off of losing weight and starts a YouTube channel called snake diet fatty if she wants to [¬†__¬†] call it that or snake diet whatever her name is and she starts a channel where C starts running her mouth about all this [¬†__¬†] I am running my mouth about basically promoting the snake diet that woman will be famous and two [¬†__¬†] months will it be you you [¬†__¬†] get the result lose all the [¬†__¬†] weight and you know the channel like that it will blow up okay check out to me Miller's channel I've coached her KF coached her she's somebody I've actually coached for a while okay she also has a before-and-after dry fast picture on my Instagram her channels blowing up and she's only made a few YouTube videos about the steak diet okay because people tonight pin snake diet now that's how easy you can [¬†__¬†] change their whole life and get out of your shitty [¬†__¬†] goddamn Dave job if you just lose all the [¬†__¬†] weight every wonder you can make a channel and have a [¬†__¬†] crazy amount of subscribers because everyone's just gonna subscribe to all these people that are getting weight-loss results why wouldn't you and you can have a youtube channel it's paying your [¬†__¬†] rent okay do it [¬†__¬†] the first fat woman that does that I guarantee you she's probably gonna be more popular than me in two months for [¬†__¬†] sakes but as long as they for mourning me because it'll be even but it'll climb up like this it'll be very synergetic do it don't be a [¬†__¬†] [¬†__¬†] make a youtube channel lose weight start running your [¬†__¬†] mouth don't be a [¬†__¬†] but what you say speak your [¬†__¬†] mind okay talk about the truth and you'll [¬†__¬†] go places not like a little [¬†__¬†] it has no goddamn [¬†__¬†] purpose in life create some purpose piss some people to [¬†__¬†] off because truth be told I'll tell you right now what's happening I mean they're gonna be assassinated in two years or take over the whole [¬†__¬†] thing that's where this is going they either gonna have to [¬†__¬†] somehow stop this whole movement or I'm gonna take over everything the health care system is gonna be [¬†__¬†] [¬†__¬†] that's how [¬†__¬†] should we're beating everything and there's too many people now making you tubes and [¬†__¬†] about this so they can't stop and it's gonna be hard it's gonna be hard for them to [¬†__¬†] stop it cuz I [¬†__¬†] I was almost thinking my YouTube channels gonna have pulled off [¬†__¬†] YouTube sooner or later that mistake time motivation group might just disappear okay that's how this works these results are so good and it's [¬†__¬†] free okay this will [¬†__¬†] the whole system either will end up assassinated or will take over the whole [¬†__¬†] thing so everyone have a great night take take the [¬†__¬†]

Meatheals.com"	222000.0	PT7M3S	2d	sd	False		0.0			26827.0	866.0	0.0	844.0	2013-10-02T03:42:51Z	Shawn Baker MD	15048332.0	okay this is a video regarding my blood glucose a lot of people have speculated on that many of the vegans have been dancing around celebrating saying I have diabetes and all kinds of things to support their their particular agenda what they don't tell you is despite a fasting blood glucose in the 120s a hemoglobin a1c of 6.3 my insulin is 2.6 I am extremely insulin sensitive if you calculate a Homa IR score it comes out to 0.8 which makes me extremely insulin sensitive I don't have any diabetic pathophysiology which would be a classic sense my excursions postprandial are extremely low my level state a very low you know low range I never get above you know about 135 regardless now the question becomes why is it elevated well there's some interesting data coming out on particularly looking at athletes there was a study in 2016 looking at continuous glucose monitors and sub elite level athletes and I found out about 30 percent of those athletes had fasting blood glucoses in the pre-diabetic range and even frankly in the diabetic ranges the ones that had the highest glucoses were the ones that were exercising the hardest and the ones that were ingesting the least amount of carbohydrates a another study that was performed by a fellow named Alessandro Ferretti out of the UK looked at eight Olympic world champion level athletes and found that six out of those eight athletes again had fasting blood glucoses in the pre-diabetic range and so what we're seeing is a trend with high demand athletic activity blood glucose rises to meet those demands you couple that with the fact that I eat basically zero carbohydrate on a you know completely carnivorous diet and you have a very robust capacity to maintain an elevated blood glucose additionally if we go back into history we look at the intimate population and we look at their metabolic parameters from the 1920s 1928 study was was when I found on metabolism and they all had fasting blood glucoses in the 120s without any evidence of diabetic complications now this doesn't mean that you can have high blood glucose and you should ignore it but you should be aware if you are a high level athlete and you have very low insulin levels of insulin sensitivities this may be a mechanism now what does that mean long term could mean that that is a normal adaptation to high level athletic activity most those athletes are very lean I have good general markers of health my insulin my inflammatory markers are next to none 0.6 was my C reactive protein my triglyceride levels are extremely low at 54 I tried the crystallites triglyceride HDL level also very favorable and at about 1.2 so I have very good markers of health couple that with the fact that I maintain about 240 to 250 pounds of lean muscular mass at age 50 I am a world champion world record holder on the concept - when I train that very frequently I rode that faster than many Olympic gold medalist rowers have done I've wrote it faster than many top-level strongman competitors world champion strongmen are competitors and I've also wrote it much faster than top-level cross CrossFit athletes so that gives you an idea the physiologic demand from an athletic standpoint that I put out we have data on people that have had higher levels of fasting glucose that do not display any of the diabetic complications that we would typically see of retinopathy kidney disease cardiovascular disease one subset of that population would be the gluco kinase deficiency people we've got 48 years of data on those people which showed despite a hemoglobin a1c of 6.8 which is still quite a bit even higher than mine no evidence of complications any higher than the general population and so again blood glucose is a associated marker of disease it is not necessarily causative it's not the glucose in the blood it's what happens when the glucose interact with the tissues and we go from glycation to advanced glycation end-products that process requires oxidative stress in an environment that will support that there are a number of things it mitigate the formation of advanced glycation end-products one of the most powerful being karna s'en karna s'en is found exclusively and heavily in red meat which i consume in abundance so what's interesting the path the path of physiology and the mechanistic reasons for this is probably not diabetic pathophysiology it to be turn it it remains to be seen a long term what the impact will be things that I can look at over time will be scanning blood vessels looking at heart scans things like that possibly getting things like serum advanced glycation end-products s down the road so that is the update the vegans you know you guys can complain and gripe and say whatever you're going to say the people that have some sophistication and understand that physiology is much more complicated understand that associational markers have to be context dependent any associational landmark you look at it you have to say it is associated with whatever lab marker X is associated with disease Y well then you have to follow up and say how strong is the association and does it apply to all populations in all circumstances and I think if you take that approach you will find that many of things maybe there's substance you've made don't necessarily hold up again Lokar populations ketogenic populations carnivorous populations our lab reference ranges are very likely do not necessarily fall in line with the standard reference ranges which were determined on high carbohydrate consuming populations which arguably are less healthy anyway I hope this clears it up go - Sean - Baker comm if you want article references I've written an article on that I think it's a pretty decent read and that might at least for you guys are instant I know the vegans don't care they have their there privatizing for the religion they'll do whatever they want you guys no one's listening to you no one cares I don't care okay for you guys that have an interest in this stuff and want to advance you're you're learning go read the article I wrote you know check out the references let me see what you guys think and you guys have a good day and enjoy a steak take care	High Medical Info

3:29 How to fix your high blood sugar
In this video, I‚Äôm going to talk about some of the hidden reasons for high blood sugar. Here are 9 reasons why your blood sugar is high:¬†

1. Cortisol - At around 8am, you may have a cortisol spike that is causing high blood sugars.¬†
2. Low blood sugar - Your body‚Äôs hormones may overcompensate for low blood sugar and cause high blood sugar.¬†

3. Late-night snacks - Snacks, especially ones full of carbs, can boost your blood sugar.¬†
4. Sugar the day before - Even sugar from the day before can significantly boost your blood sugar 24 hours later.¬†

5. Low blood pressure - Blood pressure medications can activate cortisol and raise your blood glucose levels.¬†

6. Stress - trauma, stress, and anxiety can raise your cortisol and lead to high blood sugar.¬†

7. Forgot to take meds - If you happened to forget your prescribed medications (even for just one day), this could throw off your blood sugar levels.¬†

8. Exercise the night before - If you exercised the night before, you could burn up all your sugar, which causes your body to overcompensate (see #2)

9. Hidden additives (MSG, artificial sweeteners, etc.) - Sweeteners and additives can spike your blood sugar levels drastically.¬†
The best solution is to fix insulin resistance with healthy keto and intermittent fasting.¬†

you guys don't drive and they do are and the bird box challenge they don't cross intersections or do things unsafely it's very difficult and it takes years of training to be able to do that safely two lonely inker and potentially even with a guide dog or a cane it takes many many many months years of perfection and experience to do that are you taking a break I am I didn't want to run out of gas on my snowblower halfway every driveway so I'm gonna let it cool down yeah we have an escape route now okay you can get out all the way out of the neighborhood so I did the neighborhood understand as well once again we got a little bit more snow than what we bargained for we did this is our second snowstorm our first was in early November and a video much like a novice the novice youtubers trying to figure out where there is you might be there but I'm not gonna put my life on it it could be there these guys we're gonna get better at this I promise we are gonna try to get better yeah because it is way too much fun so I did use my snowplow haven't used it in two years because last year we didn't need it I am very surprised that it started because I fully expected that to be the today's excuse and issue yeah and well I bought two years ago I bought a new snow blower because we needed one haven't had we had our old one was seventeen years old and it was dead so I bought this one and this one has the electric cord plug thing so it has an electric starter so you just plug it into the wall so you don't have to pull and pull and pull and I had emptied it out of gas so I just fill up gas plugged it in started enough but it worked out okay so we'll finish it up a little bit later but it's supposed to keep snowing they say all the way till midnight I know so much for two to five inches we ended up getting probably six to eight and they're expecting more more tonight and it's not going to end till midnight but we should be able to get in and out so I mean you can come in the house now okay well I took off my winter outer gear so here's a question for you yeah why then did you not just blindfold yourself in snow blow as part of the bird box challenge I wonder oh well I could have done that I think I'm being very facetious in my questioning I know that well because we go sit down have a little chat let's chat about that alright let's do it okay so Daddy dude yes bird box challenge this is an open question it's popular right now there's a lot of youtubers and other people out there doing burn box challenges and we get it yeah if you're not familiar with that you're probably living under a rock or something because it's pretty popular there's a there's a there's a movie out called bird box and we honestly we haven't seen the movie we are not we don't see a lot of movies anyway and it doesn't really fit into our genre of what we would typically be interested in seeing anyhow but we're not into thrillers so much that's not you know so the fact that we don't go see the movie isn't anything indicative of or unique to the bird box but just in general we don't we don't we don't you really don't have time yeah that's a movies are something that we don't do we have six blind children that you know watch movies in our in our you know in our basement with the you know with the protector off so they just we say bulbs that way and and yet they enjoy it and they have their favorite shows and they have their favorite things on TV and you know and on films they can do that as well but there's a lot of discussion right now especially in the blind community about the bird box challenge and I think that anything that really brings awareness to blindness and disabilities is generally a good thing well we understand that people are not doing the challenge to for that purpose we understand that all they're doing is just getting in on some pop-culture fun yeah you know and that sort of thing and and really all it has done in our world this kind of caused us to stop and think about a few things we know that it's not for the purpose of like I said trying to pretend to be blind for the sake of pretending to be blind or anything and that it is just this challenge created by the movie culture however right so a couple of things we're we have our children were all six of them were born blind so they have an experience of blindness that is different than those who have gone through sight loss or have vision impairment with some vision the blindfold aspect of putting a blindfold on for example is a is an example of someone and possibly it could be a representation of someone losing their sight suddenly and because you're you're experiencing that situation from the perspective and just from the perspective of a fully sight say decided sighted person now in an in order and and when you blind at your frame of reference reference is a visual learned experience based on vision and vision has impressed upon you a graph or map of the world as you see it and so that when the blindfold goes on your brain still can fill in a lot of gaps about what things look like what color they are how far they are what distance they are those kinds of those kinds of things now typically blind individuals don't drive cars oh gosh and they don't you guys don't drive and they draw and the bird box challenge they don't cross intersections or do things unsafely it's very difficult and it takes years of training to be able to do that safely you'll only incur and potentially even with a guide dog or a cane it takes many men many months years of perfection and experience to do that we put up a video a few a few months ago about Martha our blind hair stylist and the link is going to be on one of those sides but where all of the girls and mom got their hair cut by a stylist a hair stylist who had been who had been a hairstylist for 22 years but only blind for 13 years and she went to rehabilitation and to our state program and lived on campus in Richmond for six months or even longer to learn how to be blind how to operate in the world as a blind person she already knew how to cut hair she knew how to cut hair and she had still had the visual reference of what things look like and how the perception of how you can be saved how you can you know do certain factually still has that same frame of reference today she does she never lost it but when the blind fold to a sighted person does not mimic blindness no it just it shows you for a moment what it's like to lose your sight but it does not show you accurately or give you an accurate idea about what it is like to truly be blind right one of the things that we're we're always concerned about is that visually impaired individuals whether they have a guide dog or whether they're traveling with a white cane that the public has an awareness that a person has a visual disability or a blind blindness and they the blind cane the cane and the dot dog is not only for their benefit but it's for the benefit of the community to identify the person to identify that person as a visually impaired person or a person that needs additional assistance and is watching out for their own see now here's a question for you what happens when I should probably spread both beyond the cam but you know this is how we're doing it today so what happens when someone in the general population for example and this is just food for thought we're not here to lecture scold mom or anything else it's just food for thought what happens when someone in the general population sees an individual out in public who is participating in this challenge for example and they're trying or they appear to possibly be blind what happens when my children or another blind individual then goes out into public do you think it's possible that other people might mistakenly think that they're just participating in this challenge because to be honest we're fighting the battle every day of awareness of people understanding the cane I can't even begin to tell you guys how many canes have been broken by people who in the in the shopping malls jump over the cane snap them in to in crowded hallways it is just to get the kids across a parking lot you know people are just you know and we all do it we get busy and wrapped up in our own minds and our own agendas and our own things that we have to do in that in that time and and so the awareness but it's tough and and the other thing too is there's a lot of discussion I mean there's actually people who have approached us and other individuals in the community thinking that we're faking for some I don't know reason I don't know why they would think that a person would want to fake that but but it actually is a thing yeah also some people who have visual impairment don't necessarily look blind there are a lot of people that have invisible disabilities and impairments that they look pretty typically look they look typical and so you know without getting into a stereotypical what one is supposed to look like these are areas and I think that the bird box challenge as one thing is is is really it's not raising awareness for anything other than a movie no and it's potentially harmful because you know I'm afraid that it's going to take us back to the place where people start to pity yeah people who are blind and vision-impaired or or only look at that person as who has a vision disability as a hero only why they can function at a point that's that's productive for the jail exactly because you know we get this all the time people say well I don't know how you do it or I don't know how the kids do it and there is this perception of superheroism that is so wrong I mean you know and it's kind of it's kind of insulting really when someone would look at a blind individual and think oh it's so hard for you to you know do the most mundane simple tasks such as grooming or food preparation or whatever because it was difficult for them right in this challenge and one of the things to that we need to you know be aware of is that are the disabled people in our community and those who are blind one of the things that we're trying to do on our channel is to just show show our kids who are blind do everyday things whether it's changing a light bulb which there might be a link here or here with David changing a light bulb or going across campus or going traveling at Costco across you know a busy area so one of the things we're trying to or go to an overlock cocina Kover look one of the things we're trying to do is normalize these conditions so that people aren't caught off guard that you run into a blind or a quadriplegic or you know see this is the thing like with me and what I struggle with on YouTube because I you know on Chris's video the initial video that was done on our family and we'll have to link that one to to SBS K I had said we're just a family we're a mom and a dad and kids and I truly do see us as being just a typical family who happens to be living with a little extra something something here on a daily basis but but really the things that we do and the activities and and the fun and the love and the way we interact with each other is pretty typical I think right I could be wrong about that but you know I I do think that it's we do things differently we do items differently and I we understand that we don't look typical too you know when we go out to dinner and that sort of thing and we get the stares and the looks but but it just the bird box challenge you know kind of bringing us back to that really does it does concern us from that perspective now another thing that I've been thinking of it's like you know and again we're not party poopers you guys know we're not party poopers by any stretch we like to have fun just like the next guy but I've been wondering like you know think about this for a minute would you ever consider participating in a challenge that was causing you to mimic a person with say an intellectual disability for example I mean that would be socially unacceptable and inappropriate and in my opinion I've you know we're living with that as well and where do you draw the line I mean why right person who is deaf or has a physical disability why why is would it be okay to mimic or try to make yourself look like or act like a person with a disability I don't know I mean it's just food for thought you know we're not we're not the kind of people that would ever hold anything against someone for doing it we're not film critics no we're not and you know and we're not we're not really advocates or teachers or anything like that I mean we're just having a discussion here but but it just it does bring you know to the forefront food for thought that's all you know the other thing that I don't hear a whole lot of discussion of and I guess because we are in this vision community that's what we're hearing for the most part but from my perspective what really disturbed me the most about the movie I mean it goes back to the movie and not the challenge per se but but this business a mental illness and I mean the movie know it it seems to me that it kind of sensationalizes and stigmatizes mental illness in a way it's horrible it you know and the reviews that I've read I mean it's one thing to avoid you know the demons out there and I think people who are living with mental illness have to deal with this every day that's what it is and for example there are characters in the movie who are depicted as actually having mental illness and what happens in the movie is that they become the villains themselves and and I think that that's a real misconception that a lot of people in in general do have of people with mental illness which is just not the case and the truth of the matter is is that more often than not they themselves become victims and so I just think that these things I think you need to be careful about who goes to see the movie if you if you know as parents and loved ones of individuals who deal with these things it could cause a trigger in them it's the other thing you know that we went through with David which is which i think is sort of common with younger kids who are blind is trying to distinguish between fact and fiction right right reality and fantasy it's a very abstract thing in fact we had to when David was in sixth grade he had such a problem you know he's he's so intelligent and he loves to read and he had so much trouble distinguishing between fact and fiction that we had to speak talk to the teachers and for an entire year and I think even it went into two years we only allowed David to read nonfiction material until we were more confident you know that he could understand and recognize the difference exactly when you're reading about it as a blind person you've never seen certain things so when you're reading about and if you don't know that what you're writing what you know even at a fiction story there are real things and so it's part of the challenge of writing and part of a challenge of understanding the comprehension is trying to figure out that and without again a visual frame of reference and an understanding of what's real what's not real what's possible how fast does a plane go how can how do you know as a person you've never seen a plane don't even know what a plane looks like they're experienced engine what speed is or other light health light travels or how things move between walls or how you can see you know a lot of blind people don't know that people can see them in a car children when you're trading with children are people who are you know children you do learn those things I think a real good recommendation came from Sam from the blind life who had a really terrific video about his perception with and there's a discussion that we had a discussion in the comments there but one of the suggestions he made which is really a great one I think is go you're the blind challenge he calls it the blind challenge is go and meet and spend some time with a blind person or go see a movie with a blind person or go to dinner and if you don't know the blind person what's wrong with you know fine a blind person that you can experience a little bit more of their lives and how they interact with and if you want to do the challenge at least you know try to do it with them or you know find a a mobility instructor or TVI at your school or something like that and maybe ask them about it you know what their perception is on that and you know maybe they'll do it with you or something or don't do anything stupid don't do anything that's gonna cause you harm did you see the news story about the young girl who crashed her car or you know let's be real her mom and dad's car and she's really I'm thankful she's very lucky that she didn't kill herself or someone else like you know thought thrive that's not real smart folks so just you know think use your brains okay love everybody we do and we're not lecturing okay try to understand we're not lecturing we just having that like to have fun you know we we like to engage in you know we we have more blind jokes than most and now there's a difference between laughing at yourself in your situation as opposed to laughing at someone else just because there are differences maybe we'll get into that at another time and there's also a difference between blind jokes and playing tricks on someone who's blind yes which is nice so that's cruel and we don't do things like that if you have comments or questions or thoughts about the bird box challenge or you know maybe something if you're originally impaired how does that affect you please put in the comments below where happiness and all of us can talk with each other you don't have to wait for us to comment on your comment you know our our subscribers our family to us and you know all of you can have a communication just keep it kind keep it nice keep it up be sure and you know we would love to have your you know your thoughts on this as well so if you like this video we're supposed to say like subscribe share and leave a comment ilysm we were talk to the camera a lot we don't talk can you tell awkward this is for us we normally just live our lives and have you guys have it take a peek at what we do every day but it's a lock word for us but we were having fun and and we appreciate all of you our subscriber count' keeps going up which is you know we thought rate one person would get something out of this and be you know beneficial and we've had so much appreciation and your support and comments we we never thought that it could be like this these guys really and truly do encourage us this this is kind of hard sometimes and there are a lot of challenges you know even even trying to film the family it's it's difficult you know we do want to let the Rope out a little bit more I suppose you could call it that by showing you more of the challenges and things but we do want to maintain the kids dignity and and our own dignity and you know and and we don't I don't know it's it's very very awkward for us but we're not youtubers we don't have a studio and we are youtubers now but what I'm saying we don't have it we don't have cameras and tripods and lighting set up in our home and never where we go or in our car like a lot of folks do and look at our we will get there but you know the point is that we're we're not filming every day you work full-time for people who don't understand that full-time job and you do too well so with six kids you know that need a lot of care and some of our kids have have additional and invisible disabilities and you know which we

Check out my interview with Jeff Dachis, T1D & creator of the One Drop blood glucose meter here: https://youtu.be/tKK1wyY_BcE

Knowing what options we have available to us allows us to make more empowered decisions about our diabetes management practices, and I like to vet new products for you and give you my opinion on them in hopes that it helps you make more informed and confident decisions!

My meter wasn't connected to the latest version of the One Drop app when I shot this video (I'm an upgrade procrastinator), but now that it is, my BG readings sync automatically with the app and I don't have to enter them manually!

The app also has Apple Health integration and automatically pulls all of your Dexcom data in. No codes or cords necessary! Just enable Apple Health on Dexcom & One Drop and you‚Äôre good to go. 

One Drop also pulls in data from tons of other apps, including MyFitnessPal, Strava, Runtastic, etc‚Ä¶ Everything is automated and you rarely have to manually enter anything. Learn more here: http://onedrop.today/mobile

Lastly, about 2 months ago, One Drop launched a couple new subscription plans and products. You can get all the strips you need (depending on how much you check) for as low as $13/month. You can see all of the subscription options here: http://start.onedrop.today

reader here founder of diabetes Dominator coaching and best-selling author of unleash your inner diabetes Dominator here today with my review of the one-drop glucose meter so I want to say thank you first off to one drop for sending me this meter in order to review it and secondly I must say that I am just slightly behind the ball with my review as they did send me the meter back in December and it is currently July however better late than never I've been extraordinarily busy focused very hard on creating quality content for the diabetes community as that is my passion in life I want everybody out there to know what is available to them and to feel as empowered and confident in making your decisions on how you would like to care for your diabetes as best as you possibly can so with that in mind I'm gonna get right to the meter so I have been using it just a little bit lately to kind of get the hang of it and they actually took a couple notes cuz I wanted to make sure that I said everything that I wanted to say but what I said before is that I really like the fact that we have so many options nowadays we have all the standard blood glucose meters plus there are new meters coming on the market all the time and this one particularly is very cool because there are several things about it that I really love that are opposite to traditional meters first things first it is a subscription service meaning there is a monthly fee where you pay the fee and you get unlimited test strips and often that fee is less than either a copay or definitely less than what you would pay out-of-pocket for unlimited test strips for me I will continue to use my meter that I get through my doctor because and only because of the fact that I get through my husband's insurance and trust me I know what it's like to not have insurance and not have options to get as many test strips of you as you want or need but for now I'm extremely grateful that I have insurance through my husband and that I get free test strips for my one touch ultra mini so I'm really only using that because it is convenient for me and because I get to check the test strips for free I certainly would get a subscription service if I did not have the opportunity to get them through my own insurance what the one-drop meter it is very sleek and it is very designed kind of to be sexy it's kind of to not look like medical equipment which I like I enjoy things that look fun and look pretty I mean hence my Dexcom that has my you know pump peels on it and I like to decorate my diabetes and do all of these things so so let's just kind of get to the meter and then I'll talk more about all the things I like and a couple things that I don't like I'm not one of those people that's like I'm gonna do this big fancy unboxing thing that's not really my my thing it's very cool when people do it but I just kind of want to get to the nitty gritty I mean just for the record this is the box that it came in there was another box inside the box that's empty this is now on the floor this is also now empty the meter was in here and like more stuff was in here and that's really cool but I don't really care about boxes that's just no judgment if you do I just it's not my boxing is not my deal okay so let's get straight to it this is the meter and the case and everything else so here's the case it says as you can see kind of right here it says one drop it's kind of in there the case is made of what they call vegan leather which means it is not made from animals which I also like stretchy it bends and it moves okay test strips much like any test strips that you'd see come in a vial meter okay this is this is where it gets pretty cool so this is the meter and as you can see it's tiny okay so look how thin that is it I feel like it weighs like nothing it's just so little and and tiny and then lancing device okay it just looks cooler than most actually when I showed this to my husband he said it look like a rocketship he loves Mars so hence the rocketship analogy but so I really like it it's sleek it's easy to use it's easy to carry what I really really like about it that I think is an extraordinary option for people to have I'm just gonna hold this up here while I Yammer on a little bit is that with the subscription service they have different levels you can choose whichever one suits you best that means you can get the unlimited test strips but also if you choose and this is where I think this is really fantastic is that you can opt to get access to a certified diabetes educator 24/7 meaning you can reach out anytime you have a question anytime something comes up that you need an expert opinion on and your doctors not in their office and even if they were you know they're not gonna just pick up the phone anytime you call well most likely I'm not saying there are no doctors that do that but most of them don't you can text or reach out to your certified diabetes educator through this program and get the help that you need like that I think that is an amazing feature that they have built in the other thing that I love is the apps okay so I'm gonna check my blood sugar in a minute and kind of show you how it works but I'm gonna tell you why I love it and the reason why I love it is this I like data I'm a scientist I like to analyze patterns so with this when you enter your blood sugar into the app you can also enter at that moment how many cards you've recently eaten how much insulin you've recently taken and the exercise that you've recently done in that same time frame so that when and then it graphs it it throws it up on a graph shows you the insulin the exercise the carbs and the blood sugar so you see all of this information all at once you can have more information to analyze so said hey I was 200 oh but I saw that I just ate 40 carbs and I bolus four units and but I hadn't done any or I just you know walked around the block whatever it was you can see all of that information easily accessible in one place which i think is really great both for the user and for your doctor if that's the type of information that your doctor likes to analyze so I'm gonna get right to it I'm gonna just check my blood sugar now I actually just ate so I don't well my desk um is little actually let's see my desk on the saying I'm 154 so here's the meter itself I'm gonna bring it up as I do it so I'm get the test strip out okay enter into the meter much like any other meter you just stick the tester to the side a little one drop comes up and now it is showing you that it's ready for blood or something and so then pull this back oh actually I could probably have put that I have this on the deepest setting because often I need the deepest setting to get any blood out of my finger but I probably could have gone a little lighter on that click the drop on one drop rice makes a little noise tells you counting one five nine so this is saying one five nine and my Dexcom is saying one five four I just ate mind you so insulins and they're working and hopefully soon it'll be back down but in that case it's kind of close and that's good and it's easy and it took a few seconds and just like anything else so then here's what you do though here's the app so I'm gonna open up my phone and I'm gonna bring up the app okay so here's the app this is like kind of the screen that's up right now so what I would do is just push here and it gives me the option do I want to put in my blood sugar do I want to put in my medication meaning my insulin or my whatever else you know metformin januvia whatever you're taking so my food or do I want to put in my movement okay so obviously I'm gonna put in my blood sugar I check blood sugar I just did that and then here comes this little scale thingy and you basically just kind of drag that around until it comes up to the blood sugar that you were and I was 159 I'm just gonna do this facing me because it's hard to get it exactly precise when it's not facing me okay 159 save and then that pops set up on the graph up top where earlier I said that I that orange one is showing that I did fifty minutes of intense exercise and then I check my blood sugar after that and so all that's kind of in there on this graph and then you can bring up other graphs and you can analyze all the stuff in your app which i think is really really cool okay so that all works well it's very cool it's very easy to use I'm gonna go really quickly I always like to say things that I don't like because just like anything there are always going to be things that I'm not thrilled about but otherwise wouldn't stop me from using the meter so one thing I don't love is the case and that's just me because I have preferences okay so first things first the case in my opinion is not tight enough so I just turn this upside down just turn to I'm not even moving it yet I just tap tap move it to a little bit and this falls out and then that falls out and then like a little okay so obviously shook it a little bit but the point is this I didn't really understand it much for the meter to fall out and for what it's worth if I'm paying for this hardware I want to know that it's nice and secure in this case okay the other reason and this is for me personally is that I like to carry other things in my glucose meter case that's just me I have in my regular glucose meter case I don't have it down here I have alcohol swabs I have extra lancets I have a vial of insulin with a syringe and that's just because I will never leave the house without a vial of insulin and a syringe even though I'm on a pump and I have an extra pump site in my purse and pretty much everywhere obviously I need the insulin in order to use it and if I didn't have the pumps like that insulin and syringes essentially my lifeline keeping me alive until I can get back to putting my pump back on so really my biggest complaint is the case itself the meters awesome super light super easy to carry realistically speaking if I were going to take this out I'd probably take this stuff out of the case and just put these three things in the zipper pocket inside my purse and then just have these things in there but that's kind of my biggest downfall and it's not really a big one so otherwise everything else with it with the meter and they're very kind of they want you to know that it is easy to use and that it is user-friendly and that it is going to help you track your information on the app I think with the certified diabetes educator option and the unlimited tester option it's just something that's a great option to have and that's really why I'm here that's why I'm doing I do everything I do that's why I interview tons of different people from different walks of life that's why I review tons of different meters and foods and all kinds of different things not because I'm telling you this is the right thing for you because I'm telling you you have these options and the more you explore your options you the more confident you can be in the decisions that you make and the things that you like you can keep and keep using them and the things that you don't like you can toss them out and say hey I don't like that I'm not use that anymore and I just really know that when it comes to diabetes management and really feeling happy and healthy around that subject knowing that you get to choose what you use is very empowering so the other thing is - and as a person as I am an entrepreneur I am very keen on doing business with other people who come from the same space as me you probably see this shirt we are one I actually wore the shirt one of my favorite charts would be I'm reviewing one drop so thought it would fit please excuse my corny humor but that kind of leads into why I am happy to review this this product and why I'm happy to recommend it because Jeff dodges who is the founder of one drop who also lives with type one diabetes I interviewed him last year and I'm actually gonna link that interview below just in case you want to watch it here kind of the back story behind the creation of one drop and all these other things but the bottom line is that Jeff is a kind caring heart centered loving human being who like me is very very focused on helping people with diabetes live their best lives whatever that means to each of us providing the options providing the hardware providing the software providing the links or the resources or whatever the case is we both are on that level so as people who own businesses I respect Jeff and I respect what he's doing with one drop and I'm happy to promote this company because I've seen where they're coming from and that they care about the diabetes community as deeply as I do so that's just kind of my two cents because I'm very it's very important to me not to do business with people I wouldn't want to do business with myself and so I think this is a very important point so if you enjoyed this review if you found out anything new if you found anything that might serve you or added value to your life give it a thumbs up please feel free to share it also feel free to subscribe to my youtube channel as I'm always putting out new videos whether they're reviews or workout videos or interviews or nutrition videos or mindset videos

jackie maso and today i wanna share with you uh different kinds of products that i've been using that i wear a lot that i really love because they take care of my skin and my hair and my face um when you have type 2 diabetes or diabetes per se one or two your skin tends to be very dry so you need to take care of it and plus i have polycystic ovarian syndrome so those two things they are combined really makes my skin be very dry and my hair tends to be like very dry as well so i need to take care of myself so for all of you out there that probably are going through uh the same uh things that i've gone through or you have another kind of condition that really is making your skin or your hair um dry or looking not the best um i want to share with you some of the things that i use so first of all uh for my face and this is all empty and all of this i haven't purchased all of them because i love them so much this is the first thing i'm going to share with you guys this is from the brand simple and this is an exfoliating scrub and what i love about this is it is so um well it's empty but the greens are so small like when you rub it in your face it's just really really really takes care of all that dead skin of your face and it's very gentle as well and i don't want to use this on my face i sometimes use it on my elbows and on my knees so this is a very very good facial scrub another thing that i like for my face to take my makeup off is um from also from the scent simple brand are those um wipes that you can use to not only take your makeup off but if you want to per se to clean your face or if you want just to refresh your face they are excellent they are very moist they are um they do the job you can take off even mascara and everything with this um another thing that i use for my face to wash my face and i normally have this in the in the shower so when i take a bath i just watch my face it's from olay total effect seven in one and this uh the nourishing cream cleanser and this is i follow these guys again my camera now the memory card decided that they didn't have enough space so it just shut me off so what i was talking about the olay total effects um nourishing cleanser this is so nice for your face it just glides so smoothly and um i even use this sometimes to take off like when i use waterproof mascara i sometimes just rub a little bit on my eyes and this is so gentle and it just leaves your face so smooth and clean so this is something that you definitely if you have a lot of if you have dry skin that's this is something that you should try then i have another thing for the face which is my favorite moisturizer this is from olay as well it's olay total effects seven in one anti-aging fragrance free moisturizer with sunscreen and this is just amazing i love this moisturizer it's um it's just so nice for your face and it leaves your face so soft and um it doesn't interfere with your foundation or your makeup or nothing or your bb cream this is really good i use this every morning before i go to work before even even on the days that um that i don't want to wear makeup this makes your face so plumpy and i don't know so nice so this is something that i i already have a new one because this one is empty there's nothing in here um and this is something that i will repurchase every single time just because i love the way if my skin feels after i use this plus it has spf 15 yes broad spectrum spf 15 so it is good for the days that you're gonna go out on the sun or things like that so this is something that i wear every day um for my hair i've have tried oh i left one of my things i have tried several conditioners and um recently well not recently because this is almost empty i bought this from l'oreal total repair 5 restoring conditioner i also bought the shampoo and this thing is amazing it says that instantly and over time helps repair the five visible signs of damaged hair without weighing it down it's split ends weak rough dueled dehydrated all those things my hair is and this conditioner is just amazing it really helps my hair um it is so smooth after i use it um it detangles my hair really really quick i have curly hair natural curly hair so it gets tangled and since i've been using this um it really really is smoother and um it is just nice it is good for your hair it really really um helps your hair a lot if you have like very dry hair i recommend you to use this also for my body and it's from olay as well i love a lot of things from olay but you know um i'm gonna see if i can find a picture of my grandmother she is 77 years old she has used olay moisturizer her entire life and if you look at her skin her skin is smooth and she has wrinkles because she's 77 years old but she doesn't have as much wrinkles as all the people i've seen so if i get a picture i will insert it somewhere i know i have a picture somewhere so i just have to go and look it up and see if i can find it and insert that in here her face is just amazing anyways from olay this is my favorite favorite um body wash it's the ultra moisturize ultra mush sorry come on jackie ultra moisture with shia butter this is for all day mustard moisture for soft healthy looking skin and this one has one jar of moisturizer inside this is amazing this does wonders for my skin i've tried to go part ways from this and i've bought other kinds of body washes and none of them lifts my skin the way this one does it is just amazing it just leaves my skin so soft and so clean and so refreshed and it's just you know it is just amazing so i recommend you this very very much it is wonderful and then the last thing i have here and this is uh a moisturizer lotion it is from gold bond and it is for diabetics this is for dry skin relief for diabetics this is amazing you have if you have very dry skin if you're diabetic like me you need to use this this needs to be your everyday it has to be on your everyday routine this one is empty i just emptied this one out i tried to scoop everything that was inside so i have a new one already sitting on my dresser i normally have this up in the bathroom and when i get off the back of the shower i will rub it on my entire body this is just amazing and if you don't if you're not diabetic and you have like really dry skin just use it because it's really really good like i used to have my hands used to be so dry and since i use this they are just so soft um my elbows my knees my feet especially for the feet this is awesome for your feet i cannot even tell you how good this it is like i use this even my husband uses this um he has like a very dry very rough elbows and knees and he uses this and they are not as rough as they used to be so this is amazing it says 9 out of 10 people with diabetes so noticeable skin improvement in one hour and i will tell you this is good this is the real deal so i suggest you that you uh go out there and buy this it is a little on the expensive side it's about ten dollars but it is worth it i will tell you it is worth it so that's all my products that i use to take care i have other problems but this is all the ones that are already empty and um that i use a lot to take care of my skin um since i am diabetic i really need to hydrate my skin and my hair and all those things so i hope you guys like this video if you do

‚ÄãIf you have diabetes during pregnancy, one of the things you‚Äôre probably wondering is what effect high blood sugar has on the baby. I have five answers to that which will help you gain more clarity about the short and long-term impacts that having gestational diabetes will have on your baby.‚Äã

Did you know that having high blood sugar during pregnancy has an effect on your baby, not just now, but sometimes all through childhood and even lifelong?

When you have diabetes during pregnancy, it‚Äôs so important for you to follow your diet, have regular check-ins with your provider, and keep your glucose under the best control possible.

You might be feeling shocked, ashamed, or scared that you won‚Äôt be able to change your diet enough to make a difference for yourself and your baby. But the truth is you are not alone. In my daily practice, I‚Äôve worked with hundreds of women just like you who are trying to conquer gestational diabetes. And I know what it takes.

There's no need to go it alone or feel ashamed or scared.‚Äã

Have a great week,
Tracy

in pregnancy one of the things you're probably wondering is what effect high blood sugar has on the baby and there's several answers to that let's dig in [Music] one of the first things to remember is that babies blood sugars are going to be pretty close to whatever your blood sugar level is at any given time and if the baby's getting all this glucose from you then right after delivery when the cord is clamped and cut then their blood sugars just plummet because they're still making all this insulin trying to get their blood sugars down and if they're not getting the glucose anymore then their blood sugars go way down this is a problem sometimes in the newborn period so you'll be asked to feed your baby right away put the baby right to the breast or however you're going to feed the baby the baby is going to need some source of glucose very shortly after delivery to keep the blood sugars from going down so one thing you should be thinking about when you're managing your diabetes in pregnancy is how those high blood sugars are making the baby's blood sugars high and in the last few weeks leading up to delivery how important it is to keep your blood sugars solid so that the baby's blood sugars don't fall right after delivery some babies have to get admitted to the intensive care nursery for this sometimes they require iv fluids and iv glucose just to manage this the second thing to remember is that babies grow bigger when moms have high blood sugar and here's the reason they're getting a lot of blood sugar from you if your sugars are high that glucose kind of slides downhill to the baby and when their glucoses are elevated they make a lot more insulin and along with that insulin they're making all kinds of hormones that make them store fat so the same way that you gain weight when you eat too many calories or especially too many carbs the babies are starting to put on weight too and that in turn leads to an increased risk of birth injuries the head is supposed to be the biggest part of a baby and it's supposed to come out first so that the rest of the body just slides right out when you have diabetes in pregnancy and if your blood sugars are high then baby's blood sugars are high and they tend to put on more weight through the shoulders and abdomen and what this means for the birth process is that the head's not the biggest part of the baby anymore and sometimes the head comes out and then the shoulder and abdomen don't want to come out and that's a condition called shoulder dystocia and it's terrifying for your provider and for you because those seconds that it takes to do the maneuvers to get the baby to come on out and while that's happening the baby's not getting any blood flow or oxygen so we want the head to stay the biggest part of the baby keep your blood sugars under good control the third effect that your high blood sugar can have on the baby is really part of the second thing when babies are born big they're more likely to have birth injuries so remember that the shoulders can have a difficult time delivering and when that happens they can have shoulder injuries most of the time these are temporary but sometimes they can cause lasting damage the fourth effect that your high blood sugar can have on your baby involves the baby's childhood risk of metabolic disorders and obesity so we've known for a long time that children of diabetic mothers tend to have a higher risk of obesity and developing diabetes themselves but we've thought that that's just because of lifestyle factors so moms that don't eat well or take care of themselves well teach those habits to their children and then the children grow up with poor eating habits or nutritional habits what we know now is that even if you feed your children perfectly after delivery your blood sugars during the pregnancy have a lasting sometimes lifelong effect on the baby's metabolism and their risk of becoming diabetic or having a problem with obesity starting in childhood the last complication is the most serious one if your glucoses are not well controlled in pregnancy and your baby's growing bigger or your glucoses are bouncing around going from very high to very low there's an increased risk of stillbirth and that means a pregnancy loss the closer you get to your due date and the longer your glucoses are uncontrolled the higher this risk becomes fortunately stillbirth is a rare event but i don't want this to happen to you so you can see that having high blood sugar in pregnancy has an effect on your baby not just now but sometimes all through childhood and even lifelong so remember when you have diabetes in pregnancy it's so important for you to follow your diet for you to have regular check-ins with your provider and keep your glucoses under the best control possible i'm excited to announce that i'm introducing a course in september called conquering diabetes in pregnancy it has a ton of information about diet

Joel	109045.0	hey guys this is a lot of life with Joel and sorry I haven't made a post in a while or made a video but I've been real busy redoing this spare bedroom I kind of wanted a nice little studio kind of make these videos and also um don't you guys probably don't know but I'm actually waiting to hear from my insurance to see if I email can get a pump so I kind of decided to just go ahead and help redo this room to to kind of have a diabetes room so I have a place to store all my supplies and also a place to kind of sit and change my infusion set and and refill the the pump so anyway this is kind of the culmination maybe I'll show you guys a little bit of it later but the actual point of this vlog it's kind of well it's kind of got I came from the Olympics they're going on right now I'm getting in the spirit got my I sort of American flag kind of being Eagle shirt going on here go murca but anyway in that in that vein I've been watching you know a lot of these Rebeck stories of the athletes they're kind of where his story is or you know sort of what they've had to overcome and so that's kind of made me think of okay maybe I need to tell my sort of diagnosis story I've seen a lot of other people a lot of other vlogs people have gone through theirs I figure I might as well tell mine well actually mine's kind of two stories but I think most people with Lada s probably have a similar story to mine but but for irregular type winners I guess probably a little bit different or just story or a story but I diagnose a story but anyway so I'll just get right into it probably to two and a half years ago now I hadn't been eating that grey or been pretty sedentary I was a borderline probably obese I don't know I was probably up to 230 pounds almost and this is suddenly I just started losing weight and I've been super thirsty and you know typical as we know the typical sort of signs and for a long time I just for several months I just sort of kept lying to myself or convincing myself that oh I was just for some reason that pizza I just ate was just so salty and it just made me super thirsty and just unquenchable thirsty you know for some reason that make sense to me and you know and having to get up in the middle that night to go to the bathroom I just well you know I was about 35 I thought well those guys get older them you know maybe the prostate gets a little bigger they gotta you know make some nighttime bathroom runs you know whatever and so I just kept kind of telling myself that and but the weight loss you know really kind of people started saying hey you know you're looking good losing weight and for me that was kind of shocking because I I mean I noticed I was losing weight but it was a little disconcerting because you know I had been hadn't been doing anything I've been eating eating like crap I hadn't been exercising or anything and suddenly here I've lost 20 pounds you know I was down to almost 200 pounds and without doing anything and so that was pretty pretty disconcerting and then kind of going back to our live Akeem started to kind of the symptoms finally started to click in my head I remember seeing a documentary quite a few years ago on Olympic swimmer Gary Hall jr. and he was describing you know weight loss and thirst and and so in the middle of his like you know training for the Olympics he realized that you know something was wrong and he got diagnosed as type 1 diabetes so when I kind of started thinking about you know his symptoms that I kind of figured out okay it must be diabetes and finally after the urging of my my family I decided to finally make a doctor's appointment so I went in and got some blood tests and this was probably around May 2014 and sure enough results came back with type 2 diabetes and I figured that you know I was kind of young but you know I was sort of overweight and I really had been taking care of myself so it was kind of a wake-up call and even before I actually went in for my appointment I decided to like just change everything so the week leading up to my appointment I completely changed my diet my exercise everything and you know I'd already you know started kind of feeling better a little bit better and so by the time I got diagnosed I mean my a once II was still like a twelve point seven so I think that's like a 3-13 average I don't remember exactly what that is in sort of international units but but it's you know obviously that's pretty high and it's but it's not a crazy story and a lot of people that I hear with have like juvenile diabetes or type 1 get it younger you know it doesn't progress the same way as lada and there's I mean some of those numbers are like in the 700s for their blood sugar mine was only I think it was like two ninety something but anyway so I already changed kind of everything and so my doctor prescribed some met Foreman so I just had oral medication and that's just how I proceeded I you know I had some nutrition some training and I basically just exercised ate right and did everything right for two years and actually you know after about half way you have to kind of ramp up on metformin I don't know if anybody else has been on it maybe you know if your type-2 you've probably experienced it but but it it can cause some intestinal problems if you take like the full full dose right away so they actually have you ramp up over the course of like four weeks or something and for me after only about half the the dose the ultimate dose my numbers were already coming down to to pretty close to normal so for a good almost two years that's that's all I had to do I just took half dose and I just kept my kept exercising kept eating right doing what I could and my a one sees were coming in and you know and actually for the first like eight months eight nine months I was you know checking my blood sugar two three four times a day and it was it got to the point where it was you know it was always in range so I just stopped checking and I just kind of used my quarterly a1c to be my guide sort of so to speak I will say that right after I got diagnosed I mean it was clearly a wake-up call and there was a lot of sleepless nights you know worrying about all the long-term complications of course and I just you know really this first few weeks are really the worst you know but eventually you know a lot of people have can get rid of type 2 if you if you work hard enough and you're diligent and and so that was my ultimate goal is you know I it was it was tough for the first few weeks but but once I got in the groove of things I just really wanted to to get rid of it that was my goal I wanted to get off medication I just wanted to get rid of it completely and you know maybe that should have been a red flag there because I I had been you know doing everything right but I was still on but I was still on the medication and so maybe that should have been an indicator that you know at my age and you know my fitness level and and my diet that you know theoretically it should have gone away and I didn't have any family history I didn't really have a lot of risk factors in that way so so you know looking back on it obviously that seems like you know it might have been an indicator that maybe it wasn't type 2 but anyway so they just kind of kept going on after the first eight months I just rolling on my a one sees they were coming in great they were like six point four five point eight five point seven you know I was almost like down to perfect you know regular non-diabetic person range and but then but then unfortunately the beginning of this year this things started happening again I started I started getting thirsty again doctors started losing weight again and I just I I just was kind of at my wit's end you know I've been doing everything right for the last two years and and suddenly I'm getting worse again so so finally I made an appointment with my doctor and I went in and he had me take some tests and then from those tests decided to have me take some more tests and the more tests was to see if I was type one because that that really and I kind of deep down felt that was the only thing that really explained all the things that were going on why I was getting worse even though I was you know I was doing everything I could and so you know two years ago I got diagnosed with Type 2 so there's my my first diagnosis story and then I got the first ever this for some reason the results took forever to come back it took like took like two weeks to come back oh it took like a week to come back for these results we're cific Lemos blood tests again i'm they're back within like a day but anyway so I waited an entire week which was a really long week you know if you're waiting for these kind of results to come back and eventually it came back and it said negative so you know the two tests that came back said negative and I thought this is awesome I wrote my doctor he said you know that's really fortunate it's really good that you don't have type 1 and you know so we just kind of up my up my dose and then basically a week later or maybe it was two weeks later in the mail I get my test results well I open it up and instead of two test results there were three and the third one took like an extra week or two to come back and so I'm looking at the third one and I'm and I realized this actually says I am positive for type one which was like how come I was never informed of this you know why am I getting it in a letter I'm not getting I'm not getting it form on my doctor so I immediately got on with like a nurse hotline I said hey I think these results are telling me that I've got type 1 you know should I get a dog's appointment and she's like you know so they got me in the very next day with my doctor actually got me in it sort of like the last appointment of the day it was like 5:30 p.m. or something and so I finally went in and talked to him and the first thing he was doing was apologizing profusely they had gotten the results 5 days before I was even notified about it which was really kind of really kind of pissed me off but you know what can you do so he immediately prescribed me Lantis so I was on taking 2 shots a day now the funny thing about that was it was so late in the day they didn't have any nurses left around to show me how to use the pen so they'd scheduled me to go in to see some nurse at another clinic about 30 miles away the next day when I went down there and unfortunately the nurse that never use it before so I just wasted a whole trip for nothing so I just basically came in a guy on YouTube and watch the place of YouTube videos and that's that's how I learned how to do it I've never actually you know had a nurse show me Anna how to use an insulin pen but so anyway I saw I was I mean so so that was kind of my I guess my second or third diagnosis where I thought okay well it is Type 2 still but know that I found out it is Type 1 and then eventually I found out okay well it's a type of type 1 it's Latta and so I was just managing it with Lanza's for like three weeks and it was and I was doing great but I said hey I want to see a specialist as well where in our clinic we don't have an apologist but our specialists for diabetes are in internal medicine folks I said well I'd really like to see an endocrinologist but if that's what you got that's what I'll do so so I've had to wait three weeks to get that appointment so the whole time I'm on just Atlantis and actually now my typical exercise and diet everything and and I'm testing you know maybe two three times test my blood sugar maybe three times a day and it was coming in great and I'm like this is amazing I don't have to do the mealtime insulin it's awesome and so finally we need with the internal medicine specialist and and she had never had a patient with Lana and especially not one that was able to manage their diabetes with just Lantis and so she kind of admitted this a little bit out of her area of expertise and so I said well I really would like to see an actual endocrinologist then and so they finally put in a referral for another clinic another local clinic because they wanted to send me down you know 30 40 miles away and I said I don't have to do that so anyway I got the referral but that was like five weeks out so I wait five weeks well just I don't know coincidentally that night I got home and suddenly my blood sugar was spiking and it just and so I noticed that it was just consistently high so I started testing my blood sugar a lot more they got me off the metformin finally so just doing lantus and every time after I ate I noticed my blood sugar was spiking and I and so I measured my doctor I'm like hey you know shouldn't I maybe start on the mealtime hema log stuff and he never he mentioned he got back to me on some other stuff but not about that so I figure well might as well just wait till I see the actual endocrinologist in five weeks so for five weeks I had to manage my diabetes with with just Lance's and exercise and diet and that it was horrible five weeks it was I mean I had I was walking to and from work I was running like every other night I was you know basically kind of afraid to eat you know I was eating very little very little carb meals just you know everything I could to try to keep my blood sugar down for for five weeks until I actually met with the endocrinologist so finally when I met with him he's like oh yeah you just didn't have the right tool and immediately gave me a prescription for Humalog I I mentioned that hey I kind of wanna you know since it looks like I need the mealtime stuff I'd like to go on an insulin pump because I don't know shots are the greatest at least for me and so he agreed and but then I had to wait another month to get an appointment with the pump specialist so finally I met with her and and so now we're in the sort of waiting game for insurance to approve a pump but anyway so that's kind of my long-winded story two years ago thought I had type 2 turns out I actually had lotta found that out this year but didn't didn't actually start multiple injections until June so I'm only about two and a half oh you're only about two months into multiple injections so hopefully within the next month or so I will be on an insulin pump and I can leave the insulin injections behind at least you know on a regular basis but anyway it's it's been sort of it hasn't been terrible I think getting diagnosed at age 35 or 37 depending on which diagnosed you're talking about it's probably a lot easier to handle than if I was a child because I wouldn't know what was going on necessarily or if you're a parent with a child it's just it's so much harder to to have to keep constant eye on them whereas you know I try to approach it as analytically as possible and say okay well this is this is what I have now just you know what do I got to do kind of thing and and sure there was a bunch of nights where it was you know your mind's just going like crazy thinking you know oh my god this is horrible all these things I think about all the long-term problems but you know you really just got to focus in on what you got to do every day and just let let it take care of itself and I think over the long term if you can just keep on it you know you're gonna you're gonna live as hopefully a normal life but anyway we'll we'll see what the pump has in store I really am kind of like excited supposedly I'm going to get the tandem G for the T slim g4 so you know I like the touchscreen interface and everything the Dexcom integration would be great running the pump that way if you forget your phone or something you know you've always got your your device there to be getting your your CGM signaling and I will say I have had quite a few loads lately I don't know if I need to adjust my little atlantis dose or what the the issue is but probably had a good five or six in the last week or week and a half so definitely you can't wait for the CGM and the pump and hopefully I can really you know keep a better eye on what's going on but anyway so that's kind of the story got diagnosed with Type 2 2 years later found out it was type 1.5 and now we're just waiting on the pump so if you've got a similar story or different if you feel like you want to leave a comment by all means if you've got your sort of diagnosis video I'd love to hear it anyway that'll do it for me for this video and I will catch you guys later bye	Low Medical Info

4iDx9GMCYoY	UCJmOeX-HkAYVW0ylWfSZMJw	29.0	Physical activity and exercise: A lifespan approach to maintain health	"Following the Progress in MS Research Scientific Conference, a public lecture was held to share the exciting MS research progress with the community. 

Associate Professor Jenny McGinley, a physiotherapist presented  a lecture titled ""Physical activity and exercise: A lifespan approach to maintain health""

MS Research Australia is the largest national not-for-profit organisation dedicated to funding and coordinating multiple sclerosis research in Australia, as part of the worldwide effort to solve MS. Its goal is to accelerate research: into the cause, better treatments and prevention, with the aim of ultimately finding a cure for MS. 
 
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological disease affecting young adults, often diagnosed between the ages of 20 to 40 and affects three times more women than men. As yet, there is no cure.  MS is the result of damage to myelin -- a protective sheath surrounding nerve fibres of the central nervous system. When myelin is damaged, this interferes with messages between the brain and other parts of the body. The symptoms of MS are different for each person; sometimes they even vary within the same person. For some, MS is characterised by periods of relapse and remission, while for others it has a progressive pattern. For everyone, it makes life unpredictable."	2190.0	PT21M45S	2d	hd	False		0.0			2889.0	22.0	0.0	3.0	2008-08-14T07:02:26Z	MS Australia	394583.0	so I've called this physical activity and exercise a lifespan approach to maintain health a man much wiser than me Hippocrates back in I think around 300 or 400 BC a place where I should say commented I think a quote that's still very relevant that lack of activity destroys the good condition of every human being while movement and methodical physical exercise save it and preserve it and and it's wise man pointed out that our bodies remain to move and that movement is really important for our health if you look to what we know at the Australian level an advice that the government provides all of us we know that there are many many benefits to staying active physical activity it's in quite small texts along this side it's things like if you're more active it reduces your risk of getting diabetes heart disease you can help with weight it can keep muscles strong it can help you actually engage and get out and meet other people it can help with some of the symptoms of mood and it can help thinking and a wise colleague of mine professor Nora shields from Latrobe University really nicely summarized that as saying that physical activity helps us stay healthy it helps us stay happy and it helps us stay smart we know that it can help with memory and we know that it can help with concentration so there's all sorts of benefits that all of us will experience from being active if we look to the Australian guidelines but how active we should all be these were recently revised and they suggest that broadly all of us regardless of ability could be aiming for around about 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activities so where you feel you're starting to work your breathing's a little quicker perhaps you can talk but you'd have trouble singing we should all be doing muscle strengthening exercises a couple of days a week and trying to be active on most days and really importantly a really key part of that message is any physical activity is better than none now we have no specific guidelines from our government for people with MS but the Canadians have published quite an interesting review and some guidelines from experts that suggesting that for people with multiple sclerosis in particular they should be aiming towards 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity twice a week and again some strength training and that those guidelines are something to aim for for fitness benefits for people who have mild to moderate disability with MS so that's something thought to be helpful and that would benefit people if we look to the Australian community as a whole you'll all have seen public health messages to us all about being more active we know from our our really large health surveys that over 60% of Australians aren't active enough if we look to some studies that have compared the activity of people who have MS to people who don't have around the same age we know that more people with MS are less active and that most people with MS are not active enough to gain health benefits I'm talking a little bit about physical activity and exercise and and those words mean different things to us we've been really focused on particular exercise programs for a while but now we're much more interested in the land but broadly what physical activity is so physical activity in the big circle is any activity that you're doing that gets your body moving gets your breathing faster getting your heart beating faster so it might be things like gardening sweeping the past doing housework walking the kids to school all of those activities across the day exercise is just a part of that it's that subcategory that is planned it's structured it's repetitive and you're doing it to improve or you maintain health and it's just part of the big picture of physical activity that we're looking at as being important across the whole lifespan of all of us whether we have MS or not if we look to exercise and physical activity there's been a really large increase in interest and a many more studies going on about how exercise might be thought to be beneficial there's a common tag frame and in fact an organization again thinking what exercise be something that we should be prescribing exercise as medicine if you look at the graph on the left that's just simply me looking at the medical and and physiotherapy literature and looking at the increased number of studies over towards me it's the number of studies published in 1990 and over at the far side it's 2015 so a really positive thing is that we know a lot more about how physical activity might be beneficial for people with MS and what to do we also know a little bit more about what we don't know what is encouraging is not only are there more studies but the studies are higher quality and that means that we can take groups of studies that have done the same thing and start to put the information together and get much clearer idea about what the strength of evidence is for us we also are starting to look more carefully about why people don't exercise 60 percent of Australians don't exercise or do enough we need to think about what makes it harder and what makes it easier and what might make it harder or easier if you're living with a health condition - like in its we know from some work across a number of studies that it can be harder if you don't have access or the environment that you want to do exercise doesn't cater for you and your needs we know really really well that we don't give enough advice to you about what to do and sometimes we give you confusing and conflicting advice which can make it harder we know other people experience personal barriers everyone's very individual everyone's journey is is different sometimes it might be fatigue sometimes it might be fear or apprehension about what will happen with exercise we also know that there are some things that make it easier and that's important for us to learn from so people who have access to the right environments or support to exercise find it easier people who have a sense of achievement who are able to find the right exercise for them complete it successfully and get that real sense of warmth as enos of when you feel you're doing something really positive for your health the feeling of success and enable iment and again that's important one of the important studies are all very recent work has pulled together a great deal of studies and we know absolutely convincingly now that exercising multiple sclerosis is safe we had probably had some concerns we've taken it easy we've been quite careful but we know that it's safe this is 26 studies involving twelve hundred and ninety six people and it's been shown there are no increase in relapses and no more adverse events so exercise is safe we also know that exercise can improve for people with MS their balance and again Lisa referred to a really interesting study going on in Sydney at the moment where through home is exploring the ability of dance mats to actually increase someone's ability to step quickly and regain their balance we know that balance and risk of Falls improves and there's some evidence that exercise can help prevent Falls we know that exercise is good for walking ability it can increase the walking speed of some of many people and how far they can walk we have good evidence now that exercise can improve the symptoms of fatigue with small improvements for many people we know that that's highly individual and we know we need to know more about the effect but it can actually lead to improved fatigue symptoms in many people and we know when looking at groups of people with neurological conditions like MS that it can actually help with symptoms of depression and mood so there's a huge range of benefits potentially for pet for exercise and physical activity for people living with the condition like MS there are all sorts of exercises that you can do and often it's easier to kind of break them down into what they're targeting so broadly I tend to think of them as being something that is our our aerobic fitness that's getting your heart pumping and keeping it going strengthening exercises to keep the muscles strong which we know is helpful for walking in balance balance exercises improve your ability to be able to control your balance or to step quickly and flexibility the the ability to maintain comfortable ranges of movement and to avoid muscles becoming short all of those activities we know are helpful when we look for what the Canadian guidelines suggest are most helpful we look to aerobic fitness and strengthening but certainly there's a range of things that people can do that they can find helpful or we're often asked I think as health professionals what kind of exercise is best and there's certainly lots of choices and people need to choose what works for them at particular points in time and what they like so it could be that you're sweeping and gardening at home you could be going to the local gym you might prefer to exercise on your own to a DVD you might like classes and this class is actually not people with MS but actually people with Parkinson's we did a a recent trial looking at contemporary dance to improve health in people with Parkinson's and that was the most fabulous exercise trial I've ever been involved with I have worked with people's strength thing I have worked with people with flexibility I've never seen joy like I saw with people with dance you can go anywhere you can decide what is right for you and what fits in with your lifestyle because one of the most compelling things that we know apart from the science of exercise is that developing habits and to be active and to do exercise coming really hard to make part of your everyday life we brush our teeth but without thinking about it because it's a habit you put the bean out on big night because it's a habit when you get out of the car you close the door there's lots of things we do that are part of our life that are simply habits but it's hard for many of us including myself to make it a habit and so therefore one of the things we will often say is the best exercise for you is the one that you will do so it's around what you can do what you enjoy doing what is practical for you when we look towards developing this idea of a healthy lifestyle and exercise habits we know it can be challenging for people who have disability and it can be particularly we know that it's particularly important with people with MS who are not actively exercising when they go to that how you might go around doing that we see an emergence of the health coach and psychologists and health psychologists working with profession to think about how we can start to build more sustainable habits rather than is doing a six-week hit at a gym or pain-free German starting and they're not going but how do we actually build this into our lives so we can keep doing it so the things that I think are important are to get advice from a health professional if you're not active and you want to start go and have a conversation with someone who knows you will about what you might do it's important to start early all of us need to be active whether we have MS or not if you're not active and you recently diagnosed studying activity is important but it's important to start with small goals and to build up really carefully and gently rather than going wild at the beginning it's important to build a support team around you you need you need a crew who will help you keep on track you might have someone that you exercise with you might have someone who touches base with you you might build in a coffee after your exercise or someone to go walking with what are the most important things I see from people who have neurological conditions who've managed to do this well is that they're really good planners they will sit and they'll look at their week and they'll think well how am I gonna get my activity and okay well I won't drive to work every week maybe on Thursday I'll catch the train I'll walk this way rather than thinking it will just happen it's a matter of really carefully structuring in your week when this will happen and planning ahead it's important also to think about where you can cheat and get a little bit of activity it's part of everyday life so maybe you're gonna walk the kids to school one day maybe you'll park your car further away a different day there's all sorts of things that you can do as part of your lifestyle and that's the most successful thing it just becomes part of what you do rather than something extra as well as doing particular formal exercise it's really important to try things and I am what you like it needs to be fun or it needs to be functional that is it helps you as part of everyday life it's just part of what you do it's also important to keep track of your exercise and your goals to keep track of what you're doing it's easy for these things to slip away and living within us is challenging and life will intervene for many people so if you have a relaxed or your gym closes or you get sick or somebody you know gets sick or something happens and you lose your habit you need to start again so again we work with people it's realistic that life happens and sometimes we stop but it's what skills have you got to start again how are you at getting back on the wagon and getting going again and how much you know how to do that we know that for people exercising with MS there are particular considerations and there's a lot of information available about that we know that choosing what time you exercise can be important choosing perhaps a cooler environment having hydration knowing how exercising might impact on your fatigue and having strategies to slowly monitoring your exercise there are things like over heated pools we think might be good to avoid but often if you enjoy walking it can be hard to do when it's raining and it can be hard to do when it's harsh things like walking groups that lots of the major shopping centers in Melbourne have walking groups that met weekly at eight o'clock in the morning and they go walking through the indoor shopping center in the cool environment without all the congested kids and round about the time you finish exercising it's Coffee time so there's ways and means if you plan ahead to deal with these barriers these things about what makes it harder a recent thing that we've become much more aware of a part as well as being active is actually sitting so again at a public health level for all of us we know that even if we're very active prolonged inactivity sitting too long without moving or lying too long without moving poses an additional health risk even if you're very active and you're sitting all day in an office we know that that's a concern for health and and you might see some media around the killer couches or sitting is the new smoking our lifestyles have changed this is my life I travel to work in my car I fit in my office I go home and I sit in my couch and to relax I look at things on my iPad so we see lots of aspects of everyday life don't involve activity across the day there are some little things that we can do just to just remind ourselves to get moving to breaking up the activities so if people are sitting for prolonged lengths of time often even just setting an alarm to get up every hour or so it can be a reminder so this is me and my desk over at the University of Melbourne it's not a particularly good photo but it shows my standing desk so I have a desk that will actually allow me to stand for part of the day and for office workers now we are suggesting probably a couple of hours in the mornings might be good to aim for but it's very much to the individual level that's probably the best thing I've done for my health over the last year I take standing coffee breaks you might have noticed I was actually standing at the back rather than than sitting and certainly if you go to a physical activity conference you'll see lots of people standing standing up on the ad brakes standing perhaps to do the dishes rather than putting in in the dishwasher there are lots of little signals you can give yourself across the day to get up walk around the house even if it's a minute or two there's indicator so that shall be something helpful for your health technology can be helpful we know that there are devices that are becoming common I've actually got a Fitbit on I keep track of how many steps I've done this exergaming we're starting to see apps that might help people do exercise or help them keep track of exercise I have colleagues in America who are looking at developing virtual coaches and certainly there's lots of research around telling rehabilitation so bringing the health coach or the physio into your home to chat with you about your program particularly when you get stuck or you hit a bump on the road so we'll see a lot more in that space so I guess my key message for people with MS is is very much the key message for everyone within Australia whether you have MS or not we need to move more and we need to sit less we need to increase physical activity across the landscape of our lives on a day to day basis and consider whether there is focused exercise that may be particularly useful for you we also need to think about can we break up some of those prolonged periods of inactive time that we have so I'll finish at that and and I'll leave you with the key message that is for all Australians which nicely has an airman an S which is to move more and sit less there are lots of resources if you're not active and you want to start please speak to your health professional contact demouth connect and start a conversation about how you can slowly increase activity to make it part of your life thank you	High Medical Info
4jq_OaOkGb8	UClRgvVlu2adon0fjE8xtpAg	29.0	The Three Minute Diabetes Breakfast That Changes Lives	"A recipe from Adam Brown's upcoming book, Bright Spots and Landmines. 

***

From Bright Spots & Landmines: To make chia seed pudding, I mix 1/4 cup of chia seeds, 1/2 cup of water, a hearty amount of cinnamon, 1-2 tbsp of coconut oil, and some combination of toppings like frozen raspberries, shelled sunflower seeds, and nuts. After about a minute of stirring with a spoon and about a minute sitting, it turns into a pudding-like gel. It can also be made in a batch ahead of time by quadrupling the recipe. The water can be hot or cold, depending on your preferences, and the pudding can be made thicker by using less water. Chocolate or vanilla protein powder or pure vanilla extract can be added for additional flavor. Parents have even emailed me with enthusiasm for this recipe ‚Äì ‚ÄúMy son loves this!‚Äù ‚Äì meaning this isn‚Äôt just a weird concoction for health nuts like me. 
There is nothing ‚Äúexact‚Äù about this recipe, so you can experiment with the components and toppings to fit your tastes. For example, I know someone that makes it with lemon juice, stevia, and almonds. There are other chia seed pudding recipes on the Internet, though most have way too much added sugar (including honey). 

Important note: If you have any GI discomfort with this recipe, make the chia pudding in a batch and let it sit overnight. Soaking chia seeds in water for a longer period of time has helped some readers who found my recipe hard to tolerate.

I generally take one unit of insulin for chia seed pudding, which covers the very slow BG rise from fat, protein, and the small amount of carbs from the toppings. Each 1/4 cup of chia seeds has 20 grams of carbs, though 16 grams are from fiber (80%), translating to little BG impact. 

What on earth are chia seeds? They look like poppy seeds and are packed with fiber, protein, and healthy Omega-3 fats. On their own, chia seeds don‚Äôt taste like anything, so it‚Äôs all about how they are flavored (hence the recipe). 

I buy chia seeds in bulk online; a two-pound bag from Viva Labs on Amazon costs about $10 and covers about 20 breakfasts. They can also be purchased at regular grocery stores and even corner stores, usually in one-pound bags.

I shared this in a column last fall. It'scalled chia pudding, which sounds a little bit strange, but I promise you it's a total game changerfor breakfast, at least for me and a lot of other diaTribe readers. I want to show you how to make it becauseit's a little bit nuanced, but nailing the recipe which I've made about200 times now actually makes a huge difference. So what you need - it only takes a few minutesto make in the morning, and it's perfect as a quick on-the-go breakfast - you need somechia seeds which I buy in bulk online. This costs about 10 bucks and lasts about 20 breakfasts. So I do a quarter cup of chia seeds, and thenhalf a cup of water, and what's cool about chia seeds is they're almost totally fiber,they're 80% fiber, and when you put them in water they soak up the water, so you give it agood stir, and as you keep stirring it, stir it for about 40 seconds or a minute, it soaksup all the water and makes this weird, cool, pudding-like gel that doesn't really tastelike anything. Chia seeds kind of taste like poppy seedsand don't taste like much, so it's all about how they're flavored, which is why the recipeis so important. So you give it a good stir, and it'll slowlysoak up the water, and some people quadruple this, so they make it in a batch by quadruplingit, but Iike to make it right before breakfast. And you can see it kinda gets this gel-likepudding, and as that soaks up the water, then I usually add a little dollop of coconut oil,because I like the taste of that, and I'll put some cinnamon in there, and then I likeadding some peanuts, and you can also throw in raspberries or blueberries or whatever,and give it a good stir. The nice thing about this is that it doesn'treally increase blood sugar very much, so I'll just take one unit of insulin for it,as if it was like 10 grams of carbs, but you can take the insulin right when the meal starts,so you don't have to guess 20 minutes ahead of time, and about 95% of the time I see asuper flat increase in blood sugar or no increase at all. And that's it!   If this sounds interesting to you, this isjust one of about 43 bright spots in my upcoming book, so you can go to diaTribe.org/bookgiveawayand sign up to get the book for free before it comes out, and I'm really excited to sharethis recipe and also tons of other mindset and food and exercise and sleep bright spots. Thanks for listening and let us know whatyou think in the comments. We'll also post the recipe down there to makeit really easy. Thank you!	Low Medical Info

endocrinologist decided to give me a continuous glucose monitor which has been an absolute life-changing tool and they also gave me a bolus rapid insulin work that I used for my meal times and it's just been the tools they have given me it's just changed my life it's just I have more energy now I have more control and it's more of a continuous predictable blood sugar I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes with my two last children was on insulin with my very last child my baby after he was born they they said no you you are type 2 now and so I kind of researched a little bit and they said low carb diet so that's what I tried but I never was fully comfortable with that for 17 years I kind of what I did and I watched one of your summits and I was excited to see that that I could eat plants and I never really liked animal meat anyway but so I eliminated the plants but I didn't eliminate the oil until I came into the program into the to the coaching program I didn't think it was a big deal and so I was eating at that point I was eating nuts and a lot of nuts modesty and a lot about Mikado because they were all healthy fats so I was eating a lot of that I decided that I needed to do a C peptide test and so once I got a doctor to get on board with me with that they did that and at that point they diagnosed me with adult onset diabetes that's where I am today my doctor originally was resistant to giving me the test and so I kept pushing and they finally did give it to me I actually had to change doctors at one point so that I could get somebody to cooperate with what I needed to be done I knew I needed it done I knew I wasn't where I should be and so I I went and I I the c-peptide test came back low showing I produce low insulin my own body produces low insulin and so at that point the endocrinologist said wait we have something different here than what we thought it's not a type 2 and so at that point that's when they reclassified the diabetes to adult late onset diabetes and and that was really important to know because I knew then that I was approaching this at a different angle I I couldn't expect to come with the insulin that I was on that I knew at that point even though it was difficult to know it was it was something I needed to know and I need to know that I would be using insulin for the rest of my life and that was okay I needed to become comfortable that prior to learning this information I did have fairly decent numbers as far as the neighborhood C goes the anyone see I knew it was only giving them a glimpse of what was happening in my life I was having extreme highs and extreme lows so my a one C was looking funny it was looking pretty much where they wanted me high five point eight or five point nine to the low sixes and they were happy with that but I knew it wasn't it wasn't the best life I can help I was having extreme highs and extreme lows and it was it was exhausting the endocrinologist decided to give me a continuous glucose monitor which has been an absolute life-changing tool and they also gave me a bolus rapid insulin work that I used for my meal times and it's just been the tools they have given me it's just changed my life it's just I have more energy now I have more controlling it's more of a continuous predictable blood sugar that I can look at and I'll say well I did this so I know this is going to look this is where I'm my blood sugar is going to look like this is what my glucose will look like in the morning because I ate this light meal at dinner I know for sure in the morning I'm going to have a pretty with within reason predictable fasting blood glucose and so that has been eye-opening and life-changing the amount of curbs that I eat every day are over three hundred three hundred and thirty somewhere around there and and prior to to fighting mastering diabetes I was eating even 100 gram carbs a day maybe seven d that's what I eat for breakfast I love tea probably my favorite food I eat whatever is in season for us here one of the first questions I had I had work okay what can I eat well I have to give up my peanut butter and the more I dug into it and the more I listened and the more I learned I realized it's okay to give that up for a healthier body it was okay to give it up for more energy I had more energy I was getting to a point where I felt lightless I felt like my limbs weigh more than they should and I wasn't able to to just walk around the block without becoming exhausted or just doing household chores without being exhausted I I'm 52 years old now and I feel like I'm in my 20s I exercise when they I I didn't like to exercise I I hated it I hated it I didn't like to sweat I didn't like to I didn't like moving my body and when they diagnosed me was tight to seventeen years ago I I knew exercise was important because that's what they tell you a low-carb and exercise and so I I started exercising but it's never really fully committed until probably ten years ago and then ten years ago I decided to become committed to it but lately it was getting very difficult I've seen a good year to a year and a half before I found mastering diabetes it had become very difficult it became a chore because my body was just not willing to move I had no energy and so once I found mastering diabetes and I got the tools that I needed to to control the diet to control the blood glucose after that I my body and my energy returned I I know it is important to move my body daily I can tell the days I don't move my body I don't sleep as well my blood glucose isn't as good I mean my fasting number in the next morning it is not as good it is so important I mean daily and I actually really enjoy it I really now I really enjoy challenge myself and in the gym I enjoy oh maybe I can go a couple extra pounds here and I can lift at five pounds heavier than a couple days ago and I can't I can't and I love the fact that I'm able to move my body and and the results the bloodwork it speaks for itself but what you feel it's a whole lot different how you how your body changes is it it beats the numbers any day shortly after I changed my time and started to see numbers return to a normal range and didn't have the enormous spikes in my blood glucose after eating I started to see our spirit feel with my feet things that I didn't feel before like a cold tile floor felt cold or I cut my foot one day and I felt it and it it was a cut and it hurt and it was surprising that it hurt and so I my feet have returned to somewhat of a normal feeling um I used to get a nightly burning sensation in one foot just would take over the entire but the book would turn red and it would just burn for hours and as long as I keep my diets clean I I don't have that problem anymore if I stray off just a little and sneaked in a little bit of salt or a little bit of a little tiny bit of extra fat then that's when I start to feel something right at the return [Music] you	High Medical Info

In this video, Dr. Berg talks about high blood glucose while in ketosis. When you do a healthy ketogenic plan and intermittent fasting, you are lowering insulin. 

Insulin suppresses blood sugars but insulin resistance is still there. Lower amounts of insulin and insulin resistance cause the blood sugar to spike a little bit higher while you are still in ketosis. 

Reasons for Higher Sugar While on Keto:
‚Ä¢ Excessive Protein 
‚Ä¢ Carb Creep 
‚Ä¢ Frequent Meal 
‚Ä¢ High Cortisol ‚Äì Stress

Frances Ashcroft and her colleagues have identified mutations in a potassium channel as the cause of neonatal diabetes. Their discovery vastly improved treatment for patients. 

Talk Overview:
Diabetes is a devastating disease which takes an enormous toll on both human life and healthcare spending worldwide. ¬†Dr. Frances Ashcroft begins her talk by explaining that blood glucose must be controlled within narrow limits. In a healthy person, insulin is released from the pancreatic beta cells in response to a rise in blood sugar, which stimulates the uptake of glucose into muscle, liver and fat and so restores the blood glucose to its resting level. Diabetes occurs when the beta cells do not release enough insulin, resulting in chronically high blood sugar levels. ¬†There are several types of diabetes: type 1 occurs because the beta cells are damaged by autoimmune attack; type 2, the most common form, is usually due to a combination of insulin resistance and decreased insulin secretion and is exacerbated by obesity and age; monogenic diabetes results from a mutation in a single gene. ¬†¬†Neonatal diabetes is a rare monogenic form of diabetes that presents at, or shortly after, birth. Ashcroft explains that in 1984, she and her colleagues found that the function of an ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP channel) in the plasma membrane of pancreatic beta cells is critical for linking increased blood glucose levels to insulin secretion. They postulated that a mutation that caused the KATP channel to be permanently open would impair insulin release. ¬†Twenty years later, these mutations were identified and shown to be the cause of neonatal diabetes. 

In her second lecture, Ashcroft expands on what is known about the KATP channel and its role in insulin secretion. ¬†It is an octomeric complex composed of 4 Kir6.2 subunits and 4 SUR1 subunits. ATP binds to both proteins, and changes in metabolically generated ATP couple metabolism to KATP channel activity. Functional studies showed that the KATP channel mutations found in neonatal diabetes impair the ability of ATP to close the channel and stimulate insulin release. ¬†This suggested that drugs that could directly close the KATP channel would stimulate insulin release and might be a good therapy for neonatal diabetes. Sulfonylurea drugs were already known to directly close the KATP channel and have been safely used to treat type 2 diabetes for many years. Based on this knowledge, many patients with neonatal diabetes have now switched from insulin injections to oral sulfonylurea drugs. This has resulted in much better glucose control. ¬†Ashcroft goes on to explain how insights from studying neonatal diabetes have also led to a better understanding of the impact of chronic hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes.

Speaker Biography:
Professor Dame Frances Ashcroft is the GlaxoSmithKline Royal Society Research Professor in the Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, and a Fellow of Trinity College, at the University of Oxford. ¬†

Ashcroft received her BA and PhD degrees from Cambridge University and was a post-doctoral fellow at Leicester University and the University of California, Los Angeles. When she set up her own lab at Oxford, Ashcroft began to study how a rise in blood sugar levels leads to the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells, and what goes wrong with this process in diabetes. Ashcroft‚Äôs more recent research has focused on neonatal diabetes, a rare genetic form of the disease that typically develops soon after birth. ¬†Together with her colleagues, she has shown that mutations in an ATP-sensitive potassium channel in the plasma membrane are responsible for this disease. Understanding the mechanism of action of this potassium channel has allowed many patients to switch from insulin injections to oral drug therapy. In addition, insights gained from the study of neonatal diabetes have implications for the understanding and treatment of type 2 diabetes, a much more common disease. 

Ashcroft was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1999 and in 2012 she was the European Laureate for the L‚ÄôOr√©al-UNESCO Women in Science Award. ¬†Learn more about Ashcroft‚Äôs research here:

It was considered the greatest loss of human life in the 20th century. What's perhaps not so widely appreciated is that the annual death toll from diabetes is similar. In 2015, 5 million people died of diabetes. That's 1 person every 6 seconds or 600 people an hour. In 2014, 422 million people in the world had diabetes, about 8.5% of the adult population. And in people over the age of 65, the incidence was even greater, being around 25 percent of the global population. These numbers are likely to be even greater now, because diabetes seems to increase inexorably every year. And it's predicted that, by 2040, 642 million people in the world will have diabetes. The most frightening thing is that children are increasingly affected. Diabetes imposes a severe economic burden upon both the individual and the state. In 2015, the USA spent an astronomical 673 billion dollars treating diabetes and its complications -- that's 12% of the national healthcare budget. In the UK, we currently spend over 1.5 million pounds an hour on diabetes, or 25,000 pounds every minute. That's around 0.5% of the UK GDP. These numbers are set to increase annually because of the rise in diabetes. And they're clearly unsustainable -- it's simply unrealistic for a country to spend almost all of its healthcare budget on diabetes. So, we really need to understand what diabetes is, how it... why it's increasing at such a rapid rate, and what we can do about it. My name is Frances Ashcroft and I'm Professor of Physiology at the University of Oxford. And my aim in this talk is to give you a brief introduction to diabetes, and to a rare form of diabetes known as neonatal diabetes that is caused by mutations in an ion channel, which is one of the things that I work on myself. Diabetes is characterized by an increase in the blood sugar concentration. And this occurs because there is insufficient insulin for the body's requirements. Insulin is a hormone that's made by the beta cells of the pancreas islets. And it plays a very important role in regulating your blood sugar concentration. And it's incredibly important that your blood sugar is retained within narrow limits. If it falls too low, for even just a few minutes, then the brain is starved of fuel and you will die. On the other hand, if it's too high for too long, as happens in chronic diabetes, then you will develop the complications of diabetes, secondary complications such as heart disease and kidney disease. Insulin is the only hormone that's able to lower the blood glucose level, which is why it plays such an important role in regulating your blood sugar level. So, every time you have a meal, your blood sugar will rise and that will stimulate the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells. And that in turn will stimulate the uptake of glucose into muscle, liver, and fat, thereby restoring the blood sugar level to its resting concentration. If you have insufficient insulin, that... for the body's needs... this can occur either because of impaired insulin action in the tissues -- a process known as insulin resistance, which is often produced by obesity -- or it can occur as a... as a consequence... as a consequence of reduced insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cells themselves. Insulin was discovered in 1922 in Canada by a team of four people: Charles Best, Frederick Banting, James Collip, and John Macleod. And this picture shows you Charles Best and Frederick Banting with their dog, Marjorie, who was the first dog they were able to keep alive by injecting her with insulin after the pancreas had been removed. Diabetes is a very serious disease. Prior to the availability of insulin, patients developed very high blood sugar levels that led to excessive urination and thirst. They also suffered muscle wasting and weight loss, because insulin is required for glucose to be taken up by muscle and fat. Hence, diabetes has been described as starvation in the midst of plenty. It was almost invariably fatal. Prior to the availability of insulin, patients were kept on a starvation diet in order to keep them alive. And this picture shows you a young girl, 13 years old, before insulin therapy. She weighed 45 pounds and she could barely walk. She was fortunate because she was one of the first people to be treated with insulin. And this shows her a few months after taking insulin. And you can see there's a... a dramatic improvement. Such extraordinary pictures aren't seen today, because patients are given insulin long before they ever reach this stage of the disease. However, insulin is not a cure. Most diabetic patients will gradually develop secondary complications due to poorly controlled blood sugar levels. And these include an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, such as heart attacks and stroke. The blood vessels in the eye are affected, which can lead to blindness. Then, the peripheral nerves in the extremities can be damaged, which leads to loss of sensation in the limbs. Poor circulation may also lead to tissue damage and ulcers, necessitating amputation of the feet or lower limbs. And many people with diabetes will develop kidney failure, which will necessitate dialysis. All of these complications are reduced by good control of the blood sugar levels. But, of course, it's far more difficult for an individual to do this by monitoring their blood sugar levels than it is for their pancreatic beta cells to do it. There are several different types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is childhood in onset and effects around 5-10% of people with diabetes. It's caused by an autoimmune attack on the pancreatic beta cells, which results in their destruction. And consequently, these individuals will be on insulin for the whole of their lives. A much more common form of the disease is type 2 diabetes, which affects, you know, over 90% of patients with diabetes. It's extremely common -- 422 million people globally. And the human genome project and subsequent studies have shown that multiple genes are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. But, in... in each... the case of each individual gene, the increase in risk is only very small. So it's thought that it must be a combination of many genes that's required in order to enhance your risk. Unfortunately, in most cases, we've no idea what these genes actually do. Diabetes is also enhanced by age and by obesity. We've still no idea how age increases your risk of getting diabetes. In the case of obesity, it's thought that it's probably due to insulin resistance, which results from obesity. And then, there are some very rare forms of diabetes known as monogenic diabetes, which are caused by mutations in an individual gene, a single gene. And in many cases, it is known exactly what these genes do. These forms of diabetes are extremely rare and they present either at birth, in which case they're known as neonatal diabetes, or in early adult life, when they're known as maturity onset diabetes of the young. The big problem with type 2 diabetes, and the reason that diabetes is increasing so rapidly today, is obesity. Because obesity exacerbates the risk of type 2 diabetes. And you... that can be seen very simply, here, where the body mass index, the BMI, is plotted against the relative risk of diabetes. And you'll see that as body mass index rises, then the risk of diabetes also increases. And this is a... a map of... a plot of obesity trends in different countries. And you can see that, in many different countries, the risk of... that the... the... the risk of... the rate of diabetes is rising dramatically. And doesn't actually show much sign of slowing down. And if we look at this slide, you will see this... this also plots the incidence of global obesity in different countries. And 25% of people in the country have obesity in those countries highlighted in the dark red, whereas in orange you will see that... it's... it's actually not... not very much less, between 20 to 25% of people. This is an enormous number of people. And this is the reason why the risk of dia... why... why diabetes itself is increasing so much today. Of course, we all know the problem, why obesity is increasing. It's very simple. It's just one should eat less and exercise more. And this is demonstrated, actually, in this very interesting figure that I have here, which shows the increase in new cases of type 2 diabetes in Norway between 1925 and 1955. So, the years are plotted along the bottom and the newly diagnosed cases... again... against the newly diagnosed cases. For patients who are under 30 years, who probably have type 1 diabetes, and patients who are over 60 years, who probably have type 2 diabetes. And what you'll notice is that type 1 diabetes barely changes, but type 2 diabetes shows a dramatic crash during the years of the Second World War. And this is almost certainly because they actually had less to eat. And they probably also had a much better diet. And there's some very interesting study done in Slovenia during the recent Bosnian War, where it was... there was considerable concern about whether there would be enough insulin in the country. And, indeed, lots of paper... lots of patients were indeed hospitalized. But it wasn't because there were... they didn't have enough insulin. It was because they were taking too much. Because they'd lost weight and they had not adjusted their insulin dose. And so they were becoming hypoglycemic. So, perhaps we can think about how one's diabetes risk is related to obesity and age in the following way. This blue line, here, indicates the level of beta cell function required to maintain normoglycaemia. And... and here is beta cell function plotted as... plotted against age. For a normal person with no diabetes risk variants, their... their beta cell function will decline with age as shown here. But if they become obese, it will decline more rapidly, because of the rise in insulin resistance and possibly some... some... also, some effect on beta cell function itself. So, they will develop diabetes in later life. However, if you start out with more negative gene variants, then you may cross this line and develop diabetes even at normal body weight. And unfortunately, if you become obese, you will develop it at a much earlier age. So, I think it's very important to remember that just because you're obese doesn't actually mean that you will get diabetes, because there are many people who are very severely obese who don't have diabetes, just as, as you can see from this, there are many people who are of completely normal weight who will develop diabetes at some point in their lives. But what all these... what... what all of these things show is that there isn't enough insulin for the body's requirements. There's good evidence that insulin secretion is actually impaired in type 2 diabetes. And that's shown in this slide here, where what is plotted is insulin secretion in pancreatic islets isolated from cadaver organ donors who are either not diabetic or had type 2 diabetes. And what you see on the left, in red, is what happens when you elevate the extracellular glucose from 3.3 to 16.7 millimolar. And you can see there's a very big increase in insulin release. But if you have a look on the right, where we're looking at the islets from the type 2 diabetic donor, you'll see that there's almost no increase in response to glucose. And this is the reason why insulin secretion is impaired in... in... in the whole organism. It's simply not being released from the pancreatic beta cells. And it turns out that an ion channel known as the ATP-sensitive potassium channel -- my favorite ion channel -- plays a very important role in this process. Just to remind you what ion channels are, they are very small pores that sit in the membranes that surround every one of your cells. So, every one of your cells has a membrane around it, which acts as a barrier between the inside world and the outside environment. And, of course, things need to get in and out, and they do so because of transport proteins in the membrane of the cell. And one type of these proteins are the ion channels, which allow, as you can imagine, the movement of ions. So, when these channels are open, then ions can flow... flow through, as shown here. And when the channels are shut, ion movement is prevented. And because the ions are charged particles, they'll carry a current. And so, when they move, we see current flow, and it's possible to measure the very tiny current that flows through the ion channels when they're open. And therefore study their function. And it turns out that the KATP channel, which is the ion channel that plays such an important role in insulin release, is a very complicated molecule. It's an octameric complex composed of two different types of proteins: a pore forming subunit made up of four Kir6.2 subunits; and each of these is associated with a regulatory subunit, known as a sulfonylurea receptor, or SUR1. The ATP-sensitive potassium channel, or KATP channel, as it's known, plays a very important role in insulin secretion, because it couples the metabolism of the cell, or glucose metabolism, to insulin release. And it does this in the following way. So, when blood sugar levels are low, the metabolism of glucose, the breakdown of glucose, is very slow. And the consequence of this is that the KATP channels are open. And the movement of potassium ions out of the cell through this pore generates a negative membrane potential. And what this does is to keep the calcium channels, another type of ion channel in the cell, closed. And because calcium has to come into the cell to trigger insulin secretion, this means that there is no insulin secretion. So, when metabolism is low, the KATP channels are open, and there's no insulin secretion, as you see here. However, when your blood sugar level goes up, glucose is taken up, metabolized -- broken down by the cell -- to produce a chemical which is known as ATP. And ATP binds to the potassium channels and shuts them. And the consequence of that is that the membrane drifts to a more positive potential, and the calcium channels you see here then open. And so calcium can flood into the cell and stimulate insulin secretion. So, when metabolism is high due to elevated blood glucose, the potassium channels are closed, and insulin is released. Now, you can immediately see that if for any reason the channels didn't close in response to elevation of ATP, in response to elevation of glucose, then no insulin would be released and you'd get diabetes. And this is exactly what happens with certain mutations which are found in either of the two subunits of the KATP channel. What they do is they prevent the cell from responding to elevated ATP. And the consequence of that is that the channel never closes, despite very high blood sugar levels. And that means no insulin is released and the patient gets neonatal diabetes. I use this slide, also, to point out that sometimes things in science take a very long time. We first showed that the channels were involved in insulin secretion in 1984, and at that point it didn't take a genius to realize that if there were mutations they umm... they might cause neonatal diabetes. But it took a further 20 years to actually find those muta... mutations. And in the end, they weren't found by me at all, but by... by... by a friend of mine. This is the way science works. Neonatal diabetes is defined as diabetes that presents within the first 6 months of life. And it can result from mutations in either of the two subunits of the KATP channel, whose genes are known as KCNJ11 and ABCC8. But, as you can see here, many other mutations in different genes can also cause neonatal diabetes, either because they impair insulin secretion or perhaps because they prevent the pancreas developing properly, and beta cells are simply not present. But I'm going to focus on just those ones that produce... that... that are found in the KATP channel. And these are activating mutations. And they're extremely rare. This is why they took such a long time to find. About 1 in 200,000 live births. And patients develop very high blood sugar levels within 6 months of life. And they usually have a... a really low birth weight, because they're lacking in insulin, which is a... a growth factor. And about 50% of all of the cases of neonatal diabetes are caused by these gain-of-function mutations in either Kir6.2 or SUR1. And interestingly, most of them occur spontaneously, which means that they're found in the patient but not in either the father or the mother. And in all cases, what the mutations do is they prevent the channel from closing in response to elevated ATP, as a consequence of glucose metabolism. And these... very, very interestingly, some of these mutations produce a transient form of diabetes, so the patient develops diabetes and then it goes away again, and then it comes back again in later life. And we still don't really understand why it should undergo this remitting, relapsing time course. Other mutations cause a permanent form of neonatal diabetes. And in about 20% of patients, they suffer not only neonatal diabetes but also developmental delay and muscle weakness. And 3% of these also have epilepsy. And this has been named DEND syndrome for Developmental delay, Epilepsy, and Neonatal Diabetes. And the reason that all these additional symptoms are found in these patients is because the KATP channel isn't only found in pancreatic beta cells. It's also found in many other diff... many other cell types, where it links metabolism to electrical activity. In the brain, for example, it's involved in neuronal firing. In the heart, it protects against ischemic stress. It... in the pancreas, it's involved in insulin secretion. And it's also found in skeletal muscle. And it turns out, very, very interestingly, that only the brain... that the muscle weakness is caused by neuronal problems. It's not due to a problem in the muscle, but simply to one in the nerve. And the fact that the KATP channel is mutated in heart and skeletal muscle does not somehow affect... affect its function. And this is because in the heart and skeletal muscle the Kir6.2 subunit couples up to a completely different form of sulfonylurea receptor -- the regulatory subunit is different -- and this is why it's not as sensitive to metabolism as in the brain and the pancreas. And in my next talk, I'm going to talk in more detail about how the KATP channel gives rise to... mutations in the KATP channel give rise to neonatal diabetes. And more importantly, how we can treat that with drugs instead of insulin. So, I'd like to acknowledge all of those people in my team who've worked with me over the years on this problem, the patients and their clinicians, the funding bodies, and of course my wonderful collaborators, both at Oxford and at Exeter, the people who in fact discovered these mutations that cause neonatal diabetes.

In this lecture, Professor Fink shows how the total solute concentration of a fluid (in milliosmoles per L) can be used to calculate its osmotic pressure of a fluid.  Since Blood Plasma contains non-diffusible proteins, it is slightly hypertonic compared to other body fluids, giving it an osmotic pressure of about 25 mm Hg higher than other fluids.

computing the osmotic pressure of a solution so here it shows a cell uh and it's surrounded by a solution and just looking at the picture how would you describe the solution surrounding that cell hypertonic hypertonic it's got a higher proportion of solute particles uh relative to water so uh this uh the proportion of uh solute to uh uh water is higher here in the fluid surrounding the cell than inside the cell all right you can just look at it and so uh what which direction uh is water going to tend to flow or diffuse so flowing in or flowing out diffusion is always where a chemical flows from higher to lower concentration so where is the higher concentration of water inside the cell look i drew boxes just to show you a relative area doesn't it look like there's a more space for water here than here no look wherever you have more solute particles you have proportionally less water wherever you have fewer solute particles you have proportionally more water right you have every solution is a combination of solute and water so where there's more solute there's obviously less space for water so what's water going to do it will flow out and as water flows out we call this osmosis and what's going to happen to the cell it'll undergo creation it'll shrivel up and collapse all right so that's not good uh all right now incidentally when we say that this inside the cell is a higher proportion or higher concentration of water i'm not claiming that there's more water in the cell than out here i'm saying the concentration of water is higher concentration is the relative proportion of solute to water okay if we totaled up the total amount of water out there that might be more but we're not talking about where there's more water we're talking about the concentration or proportion of water and there's a higher concentration inside the cell than out now in the middle picture what is it trying to show it looks isotonic to me does it look isotonic to you doesn't it look like the relatively same proportion or concentration of solute and water inside is outside so that's isotonic what's water going to do there will be no net movement some water may flow in some water may flow out and there's no net tendency to go in either direction all right so the was so was happy okay now i drew another cell here i drew another cell and in this case i just put put dots and uh representing solutes most of which are uh proteins and then uh the rest of it is water and i even labeled that as a as is typical it's 80 water on the inside of the cell 20 percent other stuff mostly proteins by weight that's typically isotonic now i depicted that surrounding this cell is 100 water what would we call this fluid then surrounding the cell high photonic very hypotonic there's no solutes at all so where is there a higher concentration of water outside or inside obviously outside it's all water so what's water going to do it's going to flow in and as water flows into the cell the cell is going to start to swell up with water and this creates this flow of water into the cell which is called osmosis creates what's called an osmotic pressure you ever heard that term an osmotic pressure that's going to push against the cell membrane and eventually cause it to burst to rupture that's called rysis now we can actually calculate how strong this osmotic pressure is and here's how we do it we wrote right above here that um for each milli osmo of of solute particles difference between the inside and outside of the cell it creates an osmotic pressure of 19.3 millimeters of mercury or tor okay so a couple of things to say first the way we commonly measure pressure in chemistry and in physiology and in medicine is in these funny units called millimeters of mercury all of you have had chemistry learned about expressing pressure in the chemistry course in millimeters of mercury or they will also refer to that as tor nowadays anybody know why they call it tor after torticelli italian chemist all right i won't test you on that not tortellini though that's something else tortellini is pasta all right so in his honor they sometimes call it or rather than millimeters of mercury now if you've uh whether you've had chemistry or not i don't know if you've ever understood why they use that funny unit millimeters of mercury i am going to explain that unit at another time when we take up blood pressure because blood pressure is also expressed in millimeters of mercury or tor anyhow this time we're expressing osmotic pressure in millimeters of mercury or tor so just to explain what this statement says uh here inside the cell since it's 80 water 20 solute particles that's isotonic we have learned that isotonic fluids have about 300 milli osmoles of solute particles per liter we talked about that last time so inside the cell the concentration of solute particles is 300 milliosmoles per liter outside the cell it's zero you'd say how do you get zero there's zero solute particles it's all water there is no solute so it's zero milliosmoles per liter of solute particles remember osmolarity is what the total number of solute particles in a solution that's how we defined it on uh previously actually on uh i guess it was page when we talked about this uh yeah page uh uh on page nine that's when we first introduced the concept of meleosmals anyhow so we have just this statement right up here says that for each milliosmole of solute particles difference between the inside and outside of the cell it creates an osmotic pressure of 19.3 millimeters of mercury well how many milliamps difference is there between the inside and outside of the cell 300 300 minus zero is 300 so we can multiply 300 milliosmoles per liter which is the difference in the number of milliamps between the inside and outside of the cell times 19.3 millimeters of mercury per milliosmo that means for each milliosmol of particles difference between the inside and outside of the cell it creates an osmotic pressure of 19.3 as we multiply this out the milliosmo units cancel out and 300 times 19.3 is 5790 millimeters of mercury so this as the water flows into this cell it creates an osmotic pressure that's going to actually burst that cell and that osmotic pressure is 5790 millimeters of mercury that's amazing that's really high and smelly this is all written right down here for you all right so that's the size of this osmotic pressure now with that in mind with that in mind i want to look at this chart that's immediately below now again i all right now i prefaced my uh this uh whole presentation that i said be prepared because the first 15 minutes or 20 minutes you're going to be scratching your head and then i'm going to put this whole story together and show you why it's important so just try to follow along this chart this chart basically describes the concentration of all these different chemicals in blood plasma in tissue fluid and in intracellular fluid now you'll notice that the units that it's expressed in are milliosmoles per liter let me remind you of what we learned last class meeting remember the unit osmo or milliosmo is like the word fruit so if we have just like if i had one apple and one orange i have two fruit the idea of ameliosmo is that if we have a 150 milliosmoles of sodium ions let's let me say again if we have 150 milli moles of sodium ions we have 150 milliosmoles of sodium it's just like saying so so how many apples well that's how many fruit you have why do we want to use that unit we said that just the only way we can add apples to oranges is by calling them by which a more generic word fruit the only way we can add a milli a million moles of sodium ions to millimoles of potassium ions to millimoles of protein is to call them milliosmoles so here we can see uh just as an example it indicates that the sodium ion concentration in blood plasma is 146 milliosmoles per liter does anybody remember what the number we told you to memorize for the normal sodium level in the extracellular fluids about 150 and we had said milli equivalents per liter now a 150 milli equivalents uh of sodium since it has a valence of one is 150 millimoles and 150 millimoles is 150 milliosmoles so really uh whether we use say 150 millimoles of sodium or 150 milli equivalents of sodium or 150 milliosmoles of sodium it's the same number now the real number is 146. we've asked you to memorize 150 is a nice ballpark number to keep in mind because certain electrolytes are very very important anyhow what i'd like to do is that first start by looking at the concentration of these chemicals in the inside the cell intracellular fluid so you'll notice that the amount of sodium inside cells is low it's not zero in fact if you look back in our notes in the lecture outline it was a 15 milli equivalents per liter of sodium inside cells uh we we gave you 15. the real number's 14. close enough and uh and we're but we're calling it milliosmoles so we can add all these together and you'll notice the potassium level inside the cell we had learned the amount of potassium inside the cell is about 150 ml equivalents per liter which is 150 millimoles per liter which is 150 milliosmoles per liter because to convert from mill equivalents to millimoles you just divide by a valence of one and one into anything is the same number so it's all the same number but how can you how can you just convert millimoles into moles so easily when a millimole is one thousand for the mole no no no no no no i'm converting milli equivalents to millimoles okay and then these are the exact same questions we asked you to try on page eight on page eight you had to convert from millimoles to middle equivalence or middle equivalence to millimoles you didn't change anything about multiplying or dividing by a thousand all you did was either multiply times the valence or divide by the valence and the valence of a potassium is one and in fact we said what even even if you can't remember to multiply or divide whether you multiply by one or divide by one it's the same damn number all right that's all we're doing so that's why these concepts if the math is really simple there's nothing to it but we have to understand these units because they throw these units around and they'll talk about little equivalents or milling bowls or milliosmoles and they assume you understand what they're talking about all right so make sure you without go through this conceptually all right so uh you'll notice that uh this is uh inside cells there's zero amount of calcium but there is magnesium way back on page c5 is where we told you which electrolytes which chemicals were preponderantly found inside the cell and which ones were outside the cell and we had mentioned back on c5 most of the uh magnesium is inside the cell most of the calcium is outside the cell uh and here we can see the amount of chloride and the amount of bicarbonate there's not very much chloride or bicarbonate and then it lists right after that and i'll kind of enlarge it so you can see it what the heck is this on page eight last class meeting didn't i talk about mono hydrogen phosphate and why did i say it was important it's the major buffer where inside cells anytime i ask these questions it's rhetorical i already know the answer all right i want to know if you know the answer because i know exactly what i've covered i've been doing this a long time all right so that's back on page 14 so it's simply indicating how much of that monohydrogen phosphate and also dihydrogen phosphate that's how it's referred to how much of these two buffers is inside the cell and you can see there's a little bit outside but a much higher amount inside the cell and it's a buffer all right now what else is uh inside the cell well that's what we're focusing on so it indicates the amount of sulfate the amount of phosphocreatine the number of a milliosmoles of amino acids now remember why not waste but these are in milliosmoles milliamps is the same as millimoles it just allows us to add all these different millimoles of chemicals together right it's just like you know one uh one millimole of amino acids is one milli osmo of amino acids it's like one or apple is one fruit so that that's gonna allow us to add these together here's a creatine and lactate the amount of atp inside the cell the amount of glucose in milliosmoles per liter is uh listed protein so this is the number of milliosmoles of protein even the amount of urea that's inside the cell so they've listed all of the major they've listed all the major chemicals that are found inside the cell if we add all of these up we will get a total of 302.2 milliosmoles per liter can everybody see that total 302.2 didn't we learn that uh in the nor in an isotonic fluid is approximately 300 milliosmoles of solute particles per liter and that's exactly what we've gotten now right below this that number 302.2 was adjusted it was down scaled a little bit to 281.3 and in fact that's actually a more accurate number i'm not asking you to know that it's still close enough to 300 where we're not going to worry about it but in case you're wondering well what do you mean the 302.2 became 281.3 it says over here it was corrected for ionic interaction and you might say what do you mean ionic interaction well sometimes we don't have a full 100 disassociation of ions in other words it's possible that we've got a lot of potassium inside the cell and we've also got uh some phosphate and some other uh let's even a little bit of chloride and a small number of potassiums may combine with chloride or phosphate reducing the total number of solute particles because we may not have complete 100 percent disassociation all right again when you take a chemistry class they commonly you may have dealt with this concept of a k disassociation constant which is telling you for any particular chemical reaction to what extent it disassociates or doesn't so adjusting for the fact that you don't get a full 100 disassociation of everything it we have actually slightly fewer solute particles in that water inside the cell then we might have just based on adding these numbers together all right now we have learned how to convert milliosmoles per liter into osmotic pressure you'd say we did yes right up here we said that you if you take the number of millions moles and multiply times 19.3 millimeters of mercury per milliosmole that'll tell you the osmotic pressure all right so and and so that's about what it is is 5790. in this case since the actual true number of milliosmoles per liter inside the cell is a little bit less 280 1.3 if you multiply 281.3 times 19.3 you'll get 5430 millimeters of mercury that is the osmotic pressure inside cells now let's do the same thing for tissue fluid tissue fluid is the fluid surrounding cells right just as a visual aid here's a cell and here's the tissue fluid surrounding it all right it's we know it should be isotonic right let's see if it is all right so we know that the chemical composition of extracellular fluids is very different from that of intracellular fluid uh so in the case of the first substance listed sodium look there's a high amount of sodium in the tissue fluid it was really low inside the cell the next one potassium is low in the tissue fluid it was high inside the cell this is old stuff it feels comfortable right we've been talking about that so we see that even though the kinds of chemicals that are in the tissue fluid outside the cell is significantly different from the chemicals that are inside the cell when we add all these up we get a total of 301.8 that's what you get but then adjusting correcting for ionic interaction because some of the sodium ions in the extra tissue fluid might combine with chloride so where you have two solute particles it only becomes one if they join together that reduces that number to 281.3 you'll notice immediately that's the exact same number that was inside the cell after we corrected for ionic interaction so since we can again convert that to osmotic pressure by multiplying times 19.3 we get the exact same osmotic pressure so what we're saying is when we compare the tonicity and osmotic pressure of the tissue fluid on the outside of the cell with the tonicity and osmotic pressure on the inside of the cell they are absolutely identical they are perfectly isotonic with one another it's a beautiful thing so even though the kinds of chemicals that are in the tissue fluid surrounding the cell are significantly different than the kinds of chemicals inside the cell the total number of solute particles outside is identical to the total number of solu particles inside and the osmotic pressures are equal and the cell is happy because it's not going to swell up and burst and it's not going to collapse and undergo creation is everybody okay on that you at this point you'd say you covered all this you told us that was isotonic where are you going with this right now where we're going with this is now to look at blood clots now blood plasma is another extracellular fluid we have already learned that the chemical composition of blood plasma is essentially very very similar to that of all the other extracellular fluids including tissue fluid with one exception what's the one difference in between blood plasma and the other extracellular fluids protein so what we're going to see is that blood plasma has essentially all the same chem solu particles all the same chemicals that tissue fluid does plus it's got protein in addition so in fact as we look at the numbers the concentration of all these chemicals it's pretty similar it may not be absolutely identical it's pretty similar to tissue fluid until we get to protein and i underlined it because tissue fluid has essentially either zero or almost zero protein in it but protein i'm sorry blood plasma does have plasma proteins in it so obviously what do you think knowing that can you predict that therefore if we add up all the chemicals in blood plasma it might actually end up with a higher number of solute particles than tissue fluid and that's what we see you'll notice that even before we correct for ionic interaction it's a higher number than the others and after we adjust for ionic interaction we get 282 282.6 now compare that with the number of milliosmoles per liter of tissue fluid and intracellular fluid these were identical absolutely perfectly identical can everybody see this is a little bit bigger number than this this is 282.6 these were 281.3 now i know you're thinking come on give me a break you're talking about a difference of like one you know one milliosmo yes but that's going to be important so therefore blood plasma is actually slightly hypertonic slightly hypertonic compared to either tissue fluid or intracellular fluid and again what's making it a little bit more hypertonic plasma proteins now when we convert the milliosmols per liter to osmotic pressure you'd say yeah how do you do that you multiply 19.3 times that you can try it you'll get 5453 millimeters of mercury now can you see that the osmotic pressure of inside the cell and in tissue fluid outside were identical 5430 but blood plasma is 5453 which is 23 millimeters of mercury higher so its osmotic pressure is 23 millimeters of mercury higher so once you get 23 5 453 minus 5 430 is 23. let's round it off to 25 a number you can remember because you're gonna have to remember it okay because it's important now the fact that blood plasma has a higher osmotic pressure of about 25 millimeters of mercury compared to tissue fluid or intracellular fluid and that and it's higher because of what because of proteins in the blood this is called this number is called the plasma colloid osmotic pressure that's what this pressure is called that difference the word colloid means protein the proteins in the blood plasma are creating a osmotic pressure that's higher than anywhere else by about 25 millimeters of mercury so the fact that this osmotic pressure in blood plasma is about 25 millimeters mercury higher than it is anywhere else is due to the presence of those proteins in the blood	High

Both have been proven to be effective treatmentsfor morbid obesity. Each takes a few hours to perform, and requiresa short hospital stay. Research shows that the Roux-en-Y is the currentgold standard which means it has the best weight loss and health benefits. Let me show you more about the Roux-en-Y surgerythat we perform. To gain access to the abdominalcavity, small incisions are created on the abdomen. Trocars, which serve as passageways for thesurgical instruments, are placed into the incisions. The surgical instruments are passed throughthe trocars to access the abdominal cavity. The surgeon observes the abdominal cavityusing a laparoscope, or video camera. A small stomach pouch is created using a staplingdevice. The small intestine is separated into twosections, the lower portion of the small intestine is attached to the newly created stomach pouch. This allows food to pass directly into thesmall intestine where digestion continues. The upper portion of the small intestine isreconnected to the lower part of the intestine. The bile and pancreatic fluids from the liverand pancreas allow for food to be completely digested. By altering the anatomy of the gastro-intestinaltract, gastric bypass changes signals in the body, resulting in decreased hunger and increasedfeelings of fullness after meals. Dr. Timothy Jackson: As I mentioned before,the Roux-en-Y is considered the gold standard in weight loss surgery. In some cases there is another surgery wedo, called the ‚ÄúSleeve‚Äù. Just like in the Roux-en-Y surgery,trocars are placed to gain access to the abdominal cavity, and the abdomen is viewed laparoscopically. The average human stomach can expand to holdaround 1 to 1.5 litres of food. While in the stomach, food is mixed with digestiveenzymes to help break down the food to a more simple form, so that it can be more easilydigested and absorbed when it is in the small bowel. During a sleeve gastectomy, a thin verticalsleeve is created by using a stapling device. This sleeve will typically hold between 50and 150 millilitres, or be about the size of a banana. The excised portion of the stomach is removed. This results in decreased hunger and increasedfeelings of fullness after meals. The bile and pancreatic fluids from the liverand pancreas mix with the food, and allow it to be completely digested and absorbedin the bowel. There is no re-routing of the small bowelneeded for the sleeve gastrectomy. As with all weight losssurgeries, success depends on making lifelong changes to your eating and exercise habits. All surgery has risks. Your weight, age, and medical history andother factors determine your specific risk.	High Medical Info

In this video, Dr. Berg talks about hypoglycemia and if you should increase or decrease your carbs. In hypoglycemia, it is the high insulin that is lowering the blood sugar. Adding more carbs and protein will increase insulin ‚Äì but adding more fat isn‚Äôt. 

There is no problem consuming protein if you are on a low-carb diet because when you increase protein with carbs, you double the insulin response. 

Symptoms of Hypoglycemia:
1. Shaky 
2. Nervous 
3. Dizzy 
4. Hungry 
5. Craving 
6. Irritable

5t9OJAe8Qbo	UCmLBHshIZCLlJJF3cfjPQ_g	22.0	An Overview of Chronic Kidney Disease & End Stage Renal Disease	"Hello, I am Dr. Usman Rahmat. I am one of the nephrologists at DaVita Kidney Specialists of Fredericksburg. 

Today I would like to give you an overview of the important tasks that your kidneys are responsible for and provide a brief overview of CKD & ESRD


We typically are born with 2 kidneys that perform vital roles for our bodies. These tasks include:
a. Fluid / Volume control
b. BP control
c. Electrolyte control
d. Acid buffering and control
e. Along with Toxin and medication clearance and removal

As we age - our kidneys also age and slowly lose function. The kidneys generally have tremendous reserve; however, there are certain disease processes that lead to an accelerated decline in kidney function. These include. 
a. HTN
b. DM
c. Certain Medications
d. Internal inflammatory processes in the kidneys typically from either our immune system or viruses
e. Also other organ dysfunction such as Heart or Liver Disease have been associated with declining kidneys


Chronic kidney disease is a spectrum that ranges between stage 1 and stage 5. Stage 5 is the lowest kidney function on this scale. We use something called an estimated glomerular filtration rate to help estimate kidney function and determine our stage of kidney disease.  We calculate this by using several factors such as patient age / race / gender/  and a lab value called creatinine (which is a waste product made by our muscles that kidneys typically filter and clean)

Our goal is to help determine and control potential causes for an accelerated decline in kidney function. Our goal is to help stabilize or slow the decline in kidney function. To protect their function the best we can

Unfortunately ‚Äì if kidney function progresses typically into stage 5 kidney disease ‚Äì there comes a time when despite providing maximal medical therapy - patients will need a method to simulate kidney tasks. 

There are two methods to simulate kidney function
i. Dialysis ‚Äì which are machine based modalities or solutions that help simulate kidney function
ii. And Kidney Transplantation -  which is a surgical procedure in which a donor kidney ‚Äì either from a living donor or a cadaveric donor ‚Äì is implanted surgically into the patient‚Äôs body 

Our goal is to help patients navigate their options and provide the best means to imitate kidneys function

talking Tuesday was a request and I got a comment from a user who was asking about this condition that she has I'm gonna try to pronounce it and if I butcher it I'm sorry it is called a cam ptosis nigricans and I'm not sure I pronounced that right but what it is it's kind of like this pigmentation this darkening of the skin and it kind of appears on the body it can't happen elbows knees usually it's in the armpits or in the folds of skin some people who have a little bit more stomach flaps or things that really hang over they might get this discoloration there and it's not something that you can get off it's actually change in the skin also be found here and folds in the neck a lot of us have these natural folds and some of those and some people have larger folds than that this are here on the chin and a lot of times this condition will show up the groin and the forehead and really any of these areas that you will find some of these folds happen which is the intent of the elbow or the exterior dent of the knee now as far as treatment goes there really is nothing topical that you guys can apply to get rid of this but the main thing is to kind of treat the underlying cause what is causing it in the first place and I totally believe that for instance acne just don't just zap does it treat what's causing visit in the first place you know what I mean so that's exactly the way medical professionals treat this condition there are a couple of things that kind of onset it it can be highly genetic and in that case you just want to do some lifestyle changes just to kind of help circulate blood and really just kind of try to remove that and prevent it from getting worse there are some medications out there but you really should talk to your doctor something over-the-counter that may help is fish oil or foods they're really really high in that omega-3 there are some topical medications that have been effective but again this isn't foolproof so I'm Tetra niacin some lactaid creams have been shown to help sometimes hydroquinone which is a skin lightening agent of course with all of these do you want to make sure that you avoid sun exposure and apply sunscreen whenever you're out and about sometimes even accutane is shown and taken orally to kind of help that but again don't do this unless your doctor kind of tells you to and unless you have medical supervision sometimes contraceptives such as birth control or even things like microdermabrasion um some of these skin treatments can help but those are really for extreme cases a lot of times these kind of flare-ups can be precursors of tumors so if guys have a ton of these and they're not genetic you may want to get checked for cancer or diabetes because diabetes can also onset this people who are overweight or even if you're not overweight and have this condition you should get a cancer screen to see if there's any tumors that are altering hormone levels and things like that also increase your exercise and clean up your diet diet exercise have everything to do your body is kind of like a machine everything goes together and if one thing goes wrong everything else is gonna go wrong so if you guys exercise you can lower those insulin levels if you eat right you lower those insulin levels the lower those insulin levels are the less likely you're going to be to have these kind of outbreaks and create this pigmentation and kind of increased melanin patches in these areas of skin also the less of these folds you have you know do some exercise get rid of these folds it's not going to be as noticeable there are surgical procedures where you can take out the folds and take out the color but again that's in very extreme cases and I really recommend diet and exercise just to kind of help clean that up a lot of people who are insulin resistant or who have diabetes will have this condition so if that's you keep on taking your medication and then really really really try to just lower those insulin levels naturally do that by eating small meals throughout the day snacks all day long don't eat meals eat things that are low on the glycemic index scale and really really really get your exercise up now also increased blood flow which will increase blood flow to the top of the skin and really help break down all that stuff I personally think that with diet exercise maybe a little bit of hydroquinone to lighten that up or even lemon juice and then lots of sunscreen that mild cases of this can be treatable but of course please talk to your doctor first and really see what options are best for you so I hope this kind of helps you guys I don't currently have this condition I hope I never get it but it can be genetic or people can develop it over time so if you guys have it if you know someone that has it or if you've been if you've never heard of it and just are wondering about it well if you never heard it you wouldn't be wondering about it but if you've never heard it now you know something so I hope that this guy's helped you if you guys have it and cured it please share with us what your cure was so that we can all be a happy YouTube family and share our knowledge with each other but yeah hope you guys like this talking Tuesday I hope the lovely bit requested this it helps you a little bit I'm try that fish oil try some more exercise and you know what five minutes of walking is better and you know even if you slip up to step forward one step back you slip up one day guess what that's still one step forward in the end so just keep going if you guys ever need motivation or whether it's skin care whether it's acne whether it's Fitness whether it's weight loss whether it's weight gain whether whatever it is whether it's cool feel free to message me feel free to email me tweet me tell me what it is and I'm there for you so I hope you guys like this and I will talk to y'all tomorrow well you guys and I'll see y'all soon bye	Low Medical

Take Dr. Berg's Free Keto Mini-Course: http://pxlme.me/-i717vtY

In this video, Dr. Berg talks about an interesting hidden cause of diabetes type 1. There is a chemical called ALLOXAN, which is a toxic glucose analog (mimicker) that can kill the beta cells of the pancreas, the cells that make insulin. In fact, it is used to induce diabetes in rats. And you can produce alloxan by combining the bleaching chemical called chloride oxide with protein. They use this chemical in making white flour products. It goes beyond white flour - what about bread, pasta, cereal, crackers, waffles, cakes, etc? Could this be one reason why many children get diabetes?

Peripheral Neuropathy is a really big phrase that can sound really scary! Simply put, it is a result of damage to your peripheral nerves, often causing weakness, numbness and pain, usually in your hands and feet.

Peripheral neuropathy can be caused by traumatic injuries, infections, metabolic problems, inherited causes and exposure to toxins. One of the most common causes is diabetes. 

People often complain of pain as shooting or stabbing or burning.  In addition, because there are so many different kind of nerves, issues can arise in the form as loss of sensation,  muscle movement, or even internal functions (blood pressure, digestion, etc).

Peripheral Neuropathy is something you do not want to mess with or let progress.  We, here at In Motion OC, are able to help nerves maintain function and facilitate proper motor patterns, along with balance training.  

If you are experiencing tingling, weakness or sharp pain in your hands or feet, don't hesitate to contact us!

Christy Funke my dad husband it was he the only one of interest you can remember and we're doing a demo and dr. Anne Bingham and Brian Hart will all be presenting and also we would love to have there is a fabulous camp well now camp for plant-based women warriors what are the gates June June 4th and 7th and it's in Gambier Ohio Ohio on the Kenyon College College campus babba so crazy some of the fun fun things you do that you think oh my gosh I haven't done this for and so yeah yeah so it's just it's not a lot it's not a conference at all it is camp you're up and moving and playing and interacting with always a great food yes all plant-based hope you see such interesting people from all over so we are not forking around we're serious we want to see you there March 7th cleveland ohio june 4th or seventh Gambier Ohio thank you bye bye hi I'm Jane Esselstyn I'm an Esselstyn and today it's a little bit different I made Jane do this today this is this is me today well aunt Bulow I mean making you do what you're gonna do well cuz it's more of a discussion today it's not a recipe it's not working on some sort of delicious menu for you guys but what I'm going to talk about is type 2 diabetes and how a plant-based diet is a great way to manage not just manage but to actually prevent and reverse type of diabetes why I was interested in having her explain why you actually wanted me to do it well I actually in fact believe it or not I mean I knew people got diabetes and I knew maybe don't eat a lot of sugar I really had no idea until Jane did her magic and then suddenly oh my goodness it was so clear so I said you have got to do one of these little youtubes just on diabetes and so here it is today thank you I'll take you from here all right bye can't wait to watch it again you've seen it a million times okay this and this wait I'm going to describe this today with some props and some just to allow for other learning styles and understanding the mechanism behind what is causing diabetes type 2 diabetes and a lot of where I have found my understanding comes from some of the presenters I've seen over the years and the research done over the years mostly by dr. Neal Barnard in this book which is dr. Neal Barnard is program for reversing diabetes it is a scientifically proven system for reversing diabetes without drugs please check out this book if you know or love anybody with type-2 diabetes or someone who's trying to prevent it you know it has metabolic syndrome or wants to not have that but this book is what's so exciting this book by my friends Robbie and Cyrus or Cyrus and Robbie on the book here it's called mastering diabetes this comes out in February of 2020 I'm not sure when you're watching this but this book will be just a brilliant way to continue an understanding of how plants and eating plants as your food can really help not just again manage diabetes but prevent it from happening and reverse it type two that is okay so I'm going to talk right now about what's happening inside the body this is clearly an artery a blood vessel and it's been cut open for your viewing pleasure and it's just still keep beautiful blood vessels there are all sorts of things that are flowing through our blood vessels but today since we're talking about diabetes we're going to focus on glucose or sugar sugar is obviously what we eat different versions of it but it's called glucose in our body so we all eat food chomp chomp chomp it breaks down in our belly so first we're gonna talk about all of us and people who don't have diabetes at all just Chomp Chomp Chomp you break it down in your belly into all different kinds of glucose so glucose is flowing through your blood vessels and glucose is trying to get into your cells when glucose is in your cells you've got energy you've got where nurse you're ready to like stay awake for the whole movie you're ready to dance all night long you got energy to to drive without getting sleepy to interact with your loved ones and not drift off but you have to get the glucose into the cells so how does it happen glucose gets transported into the cells with a transport molecule molecule which is called insulin boom here it is insulin insulin comes over and says hey we just heard we ate a meal so we're gonna take this insulin over here and then we're gonna dock on right here beep beep beep beep and drop off the insulin into the cells Pete beat doc on here drop it up drop it off here you go there's glucose in the cells we feel awake aware we've got energy to run to move to groove to dance to yoga pay attention be alert be awake and the blood sugar level is lower but we still have some blood sugar in our in our blood ok that's type like I said that's type nothing it's just a normal healthy the way that we consume food and get the glucose into ourselves with the help of insulin all right let's talk about people with type 1 diabetes for a moment ok people with type 1 diabetes they eat food chomp chomp chomp breaks down their belly glucose goes flowing into their bloodstream and people with type 1 diabetes they don't make trucks they don't make insulin so they can't get the glucose into their cells and in order to survive we need to have glucose in our cells just for a simple deal of function ourselves to function be alive so thank goodness for whoever invented insulin and we can inject it or have it for the pump into our body or into their bodies if they have type 1 diabetes and do just fine so the next thing I want to talk about is type 2 diabetes and I wish I was a magician and you didn't see what I'm about to do but I'm about to do cover the cells over here with a little something-something okay so let's talk about type 2 diabetes people with type 2 diabetes they eat food chomp chomp chomp breaks down their belly into glucose which goes flowing into their bloodstream people have type 2 diabetes they do make insulin they make trucks comes along and says hey let's go over buddy I'm going to transport you here over to the cells and we're going to dock on here and drop you off dock on drop off duck on drop off drop off hmm what's happened to the blood sugar level here the blood sugar level is still high for some reason these cells have become insulin resistant this can't dock on drop it off efficiently something's going on and clearly it's this white stuff in here but what this is displaying is something called interim biocellular lipid intra within my own muscle cellular cellular lipid fat and this builds up on the cells actually within the cells to the point where these the cells can't get the glucose in because the insulin can't sort of dock on or unlock or get it in there's a wonderful metaphor in dr.neil barnard book about insulin being a key and unlocking the door so glucose can get in this is sort of the truck dropping a table version so how did this get in here in the first place well I like to break it down into just really simple visual terms this basically represents oil and I say oil I mean olive oil canola oil extra extra virgin olive oil extra virgin virgin olive oil coconut oil peanut oil oil within food like oil in a salad dressing oil in a and a loaf of bread oil in sauces salad dressings just all these just oil is oil is oil and let me say again coconut oil coconut oil coconut oil okay so this then let's have this represent and you sort of the saturated fat in and meat and animal animal protein namely like pork chops or hamburgers or turkey chicken fish all those cells and fish every cells got the lipids and I have trouble thinking of all them meat because I don't eat meat some shrimp anybody here wanna chime in what animals my forgetting here eggs I'll say eggs eggs are just simply animals that are live yet but it's all the same components so hot dogs there you go and this is dairy meaning milk cheese butter eggs yogurt extra virgin olive joke no no not that's oil I'm it's a Greek Greek yogurt extra virgin Greek yogurt sour cream thank you custard ice creams all kinds of dairy I'm dairy and the cream in your coffee all this Derek that is found in places that we don't even really know respect to find it and then this is kind of just oh and I'll say here also in dairy I'll say eggs again because some people think that eggs are dairy but dairy and eggs are quite different and this is sort of processed foods this is the hardest thing for people to give up sometimes people can wrap their head around no meat no dairy they're not using oil but then processed food this is things that make your life kind of easy sometimes you know the prepackaged things especially like impossible burgers and stuff which is mostly made of oils and they say they're plant-based but there's not a lot of like plant in there it's sort of oils and and other components so beyond burger impossible burger beyond sausage I don't mean to slamming the companies I'm slamming the ingredients in the I love that they're making an effort to get people off of animals in their life but I really would like to have it not having as much oil and just I mean like Halloween stuff things in vending machines we've read an article the other day about kids getting snacks after their soccer games that have more calories and then they burned in the soccer games so I mean like just Chex Mix and all those big trail mix tea things that might have you know oils and grease in them so just grease meat cheese out of your diet and if you're on a plant-based diet and you no longer have the oil and the meat and the cheese and the grease gunking up your cells the insulin can dock on weight more easily and drop off all this all this glucose can get back into the cells quite easily when insulin comes over and unlocks and docks off while keeping your blood sugar level where it should be now I often compare this stuff to hair in the shower drain if you're taking a shower and you've got hair in your drain you don't say oh I can't just a shower anymore it doesn't work I know no more no more showering no more water that's like saying no more sugar in my diet sugar is not the issue sugar is not the issue with type-2 diabetic diabetes it's the stuff that's dunking up the cells so there wasn't they won't work properly so pulling the hair out of the drain is like pulling the grease the meat the cheese out of your diet and your blood sugar level starts to normalize so take it easy on your medications because your medications by overwork and make you hypoglycemic and another comparison I make with this is like having you know your leaves and your gutter if it's raining raining raining as it naturally does and your gutters should should just drain all that water down they're not going to work properly if your gutters are filled with leaf and all the leaf you know break down you need to just clear it out that's like clearing out the grease that mean the cheese from your diet okay I hope this helps you understand the possibility of a plant-based diet helping to reverse and prevent and reverse type 2 diabetes and maintain level blood blood sugar this actually has been supported by the American Diabetes Association for a couple years now there's wonderful articles out there by dr. Neal Barnard these guys have amazing research they're working on and Carolyn Trapp also has some wonderful papers out there if you want to research it further please do so and share this with anybody you know and love who's dealing with type-2 diabetes or wants to prevent it thank you [Music]	Low Medical Info

My name is Rei. I'm currently¬†pregnant, at 32 weeks with my second child and have gestational diabetes. ""Hi!"" You¬†need to measure your blood glucose level¬†¬† four times a day. I set a timer but it's¬†very very difficult to fit everything in. You can only have complex carbs. It is quite¬†restrictive. It is very difficult. You can't have¬†¬† refined sugar. When you have any carbohydrates,¬†you need to have some kind of protein.¬†¬† There's this growing consensus that¬†it's your lifestyle, it's your fault.¬†¬† I was worried about the baby. I was also worried¬†about if I would be diabetic in future. I have¬†¬† been, you know, encouraged by the diabetes team¬†to, you know, stay active. I make time to do it¬†¬† for myself, for my, kind of, mental sanity at this¬†really difficult time. When you have gestational¬†¬† diabetes, you're offered a scan every four weeks,¬†from 28 weeks onwards, and this is my 32 weeks¬†¬† scan. Hello. Just finished the scan. The baby's¬†doing fine but her abdominal circumference has,¬†¬† kind of, shown up, which means that I'm¬†not controlling blood sugar really well¬†¬† and it's really disappointing. There are¬†days I feel like I should be careful and¬†¬† not eat so much carbs but I'm in the middle¬†of something and I'm feeding Joshua or,¬†¬† you know, I need to grab something really¬†quick. It's been really hard for me.¬†¬† Yeah. This is what I did to relax. I knit a lot¬†of hats with Joshua. Having the right support¬†¬† and understanding from family and friends¬†is really important. ""You want to say hi? Hi."" My blood sugar went back to¬†normal level immediately after¬†¬† I gave birth. I'm really thankful about the¬†care I received. They said breastfeeding really¬†¬† reduces the risk of me developing diabetes and¬†my baby developing type 2 diabetes in the future.¬†¬† Last night that's why I was feeding¬†Emily and Joshua and¬†¬† sometimes my husband would just feed me because I¬†was ravenously hungry. So that's a family meal for¬†¬† all. The other advice they gave was to maintain¬†a healthy lifestyle, a healthy diet, so lots of¬†¬† complex carbs instead of white carbs as a way¬†of preventing type 2 diabetes. Because I have an¬†¬† increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes,¬†I should get an annual check. If someone has¬†¬† gestational diabetes, know that it's entirely not¬†your fault. Do what's right for you and your baby."	High Medical Info

Carb counting. Insulin administration. Blood glucose monitoring. Meal planning. Care-giver training. It‚Äôs all part of Kai‚Äôs mom's routine and a lifestyle she‚Äôs learned to embrace as she manages Kai‚Äôs Type 1 diabetes (T1D). T1D is an autoimmune condition impacting insulin production and blood sugar regulation. It‚Äôs not preventable nor curable but it is manageable. For families like Kai's, that typically means adjusting to a 'new normal' that requires a balancing act of care in order to avoid potential life-threatening complications.

He runs andplays like any other kid. I make sure he's a kid first then we treat thediabetes. Type one it is not reversible, non curable and nothing thekid can do can prevent it. Nobody can prevent it. Our lives in general changedbecause you're taking out a lot of time to make sure he's healthy. It's 24/7365 day and there's no breaks. You prepare meals by counting every carb. He gets a shot of insulin before each meal or before hesnacks or eats anything that has carbs in it. From the time of diagnosisover a year ago to now I mean this is just an everyday thing that we justincorporate into our life now. I was inspired by how Kai's mom did so wellwith the diagnosis. She handled it like a champ. It's interesting because she's notalone. We treat over 1,800 patients here at Nationwide Children's with type 1diabetes. The biggest struggle I see in kids like Kai and their families is theadjustment to diabetes care into their lives. When you're first diagnosed withdiabetes insulin is a scary thing and such small doses can be such a bigimpact. You have to have the right amounts. Can drop you too low you can gointo seizures or coma. The endo clinic in the first two weeks I probably called20 times because that was my backup. That's what I needed.Diabetes care in children is even more challenging than adults because theygrow, they do different activities, they're eating different kinds of food,different amounts of food... they need all that for growth development so we don'trestrict their intake. Your blood Sugar's have to be monitored to prevent low, toprevent high blood glucose levels. The continuous glucose monitor is a monitorthat he wears on his arm, stomach or his low back that monitors his bloodsugar every five minutes. His alarm is set so if he starts trendingbelow 70 or above 300 the alarm on my phone goes off and I can treat that.Whether I'm with him or not with him he has to be monitored so any caregiver hadto be trained. You're trusting the caregiver with your kid's life andmonitoring their symptoms. What's the outcome I want? That I'm showing him howimportant his care of diabetes is.  The best part of being Kai's mom... I guess I'mjust happy that I was the one chosen for him.	High Medical Info

conditions all over the world we think well i just have acne or i just have rosacea or i just have psoriasis there's i just have it maybe it's genetic maybe i was exposed to something what if there was a root cause behind numerous very very common skin conditions and by taking control of this root cause after you detect it you could actually greatly improve your skin condition yeah that sounds like a big deal right i'm dr ken berry a family physician with 20 years of clinical practice and this video is going to explain to you seven skin signs of insulin resistance and you may have never heard of insulin resistance but even if you haven't it can still really affect your health and affect your skin this video is going to help you understand that and more first of all let's discuss three different terms and uh help you understand what they mean and also the fact that they mean effectively the same thing the first term is insulin resistance and most doctors have heard of this term before and most doctors and most patients take that to mean that our cells just don't respond to insulin like they once did and that therefore your blood sugar goes up you can't get blood sugar from your bloodstream into your cells the second term is metabolic syndrome and there's a this is a formal diagnosis there are multiple different signs of this if you have a certain number of those signs then you have metabolic syndrome but it's basically the same thing as insulin resistance then the third term which i think describes both insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome the best of all is hyperinsulinemia which means you've got a chronically elevated level of insulin in your bloodstream and so you can really think of all three terms interchangeably uh they are different from each other in little ways but the overarching paradigm of thinking about these is your insulin level in your blood is chronically high and that leads to either causing the skin conditions i'm about to tell you about in many people and then other people making these skin conditions much much worse than they would be otherwise these skin conditions are very very common and if you don't suffer from one i guarantee you you have a friend or a loved one who does suffer from one of these skin conditions while i'm going through this list of conditions if you hear a condition you're like oh yeah my buddy fred has that or my daughter amy has that please consider sharing this video with them because knowing this root cause behind their skin condition can make all the difference in the world at the end of this video i'm going to tell you about three lab tests that you can go to your doctor and request respectfully and lovingly or demand either way demand these three tests and they will give you insight into whether you have metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia all three of which are intimately linked to all of the skin conditions i'm about to tell you about are you ready here we go number one is early onset male pattern baldness now you may have thought that this was a sign that you had too much testosterone or that you had bad genetics and indeed both of these do play a small role but male pattern baldness is very very closely linked to insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia especially the earlier the onset so and this can be in men or women this is male pattern baldness not just male baldness and so some women suffer from male pattern baldness if you're a man or woman and you have early onset male pattern baldness you need to go to your doctor and demand the three tests i'm going to tell you about at the end the next skin condition is skin tags now many many millions of people have skin tags if you just have one or two tiny ones that may not be a big deal but if you have three or more that are medium to large in size you almost certainly have some degree of insulin resistance and you should ask for the three tests i'm going to tell you about the next skin condition on the list is acanthosis nigricons this is a brownness or a darkness of the skin on the back of the neck or under the arms or in the groin this is almost 100 of the time a sign of insulin resistance metabolic syndrome or hyper insulinemia this usually happens to people with darker skin pigment but it can happen in lighter skin pigments as well it is it is a very very concerning sign that you're insulin resistant and that you need these three tests the next skin condition is hydratingitis suprativa this is a very very annoying skin condition that you can have in your armpits or in your groin that is just chronic and comes and goes and it's just it's just a terrible condition to have and many many many people in most doctors have no idea that it is very very tightly related to having insulin resistance and the three tests at the end of this video will help you tease this out the next skin condition is one of the most common skin conditions in the world and that's acne yeah acne is very very closely related to having insulin resistance now if you've heard much about insulin resistance in the past you know that typically people who are overweight or obese and older in age typically have insulin resistance here's the thing very young people and also very slender people can have insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia very commonly if they're if you have a teenager or someone in their 20s and they have not just a pimple or tube i'm talking about a substantial case of acne a severe case of acne they almost certainly have hyperinsulinemia or insulin resistance and there's no need to wait til you're 40 or 50 or 60 years old to get these tests checked if you have a teenage loved one who has moderate to severe acne they need these tests checked asap the next skin condition is rosacea i actually have rosacea although you can't tell it now because i got the the test check that i'm going to tell you about and then i did the things that make my insulin resistance my hyperinsulinemia get better and go away and therefore my rosacea went away as well rosacea can be quite concerning you can actually have a buildup of blood vessels in the skin of your cheeks and nose you can wind up with a severe condition called rhinophyma where your nose actually becomes bumpy and enlarged because of years and years of damage from the rosacea so if you if you have even a mild case of rosacea get these tests checked i implore you and the last two skin conditions are eczema or atopic dermatitis and psoriasis millions of people of all ages suffer from these conditions and almost every single one of these people have no idea that both of these conditions are very very closely linked with having insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia even very very young children can have hyper hyperinsulinemia and that's why the three tests i'm about to tell you about are so important if you were just surprised by one of the skin conditions that i talked about being related to insulin resistance and you're like no my doctor said it was genetic or it was just luck of the draw i've included lots of research links down in the show notes below that you can find your particular skin condition or the skin condition of a loved one and look it up and so when you go to your doctor to ask for these three tests if your doctor says you have acne that doesn't mean you have insulin resistance you can whip out the studies that you printed off from doc off of dr barry's video and say actually doctor these studies seem to suggest that this skin condition is very very closely related to insulin resistance will you please check my labs so the three lab tests that you really need to strongly yet gently requests from your doctor are a hemoglobin a1c which is going to give you a three month average of what your blood sugar has been doing it's a great test for checking if your blood sugar spikes high occasionally or daily you can see that on a hemoglobin a1c the second test is a c peptide this is a beautiful proxy marker for how much insulin your pancreas is having to produce each day and then the third test is a fasting insulin test and this is going to be elevated if your pancreas is having to excrete lots and lots of insulin every day now finally what do you do okay so you you got one of these skin conditions and you went to the doctor and you got these three tests checked and sure enough you have insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia or metabolic syndrome now what do you do these all three of these conditions and all of these skin conditions are either caused by or made worse by eating a high carbohydrate diet you need to start to investigate and start to implement a very low carbohydrate diet some people call this a ketogenic way of eating or ketogenic diet keto diet some people have to go even lower carb than that to a ketovore diet which is a ketogenic diet that's mainly fatty meat and a little bit of veg some people have to go all the way to a full carnivore diet in order to get the carbohydrates in their diet low enough that their insulin level will come back down to normal and their insulin resistance will go away or at least get a lot better at the end of this video i'm going to have playlists pop up here and here for keto or carnivore so if you're if you'd be happy just eating meat check out the carnivore 101 playlist if you need a little veg in your life then check out the keto 101 playlist either one of these dietary strategies is going to reduce your chronically elevated levels of insulin and cause all of your cells to be more insulin sensitive and cause all of these skin conditions we talked about in this video to improve if you enjoyed this video and the pictures and would like to

Chewie, come here! Just started grad school. Chewie! And didn't have the lifethat I wanted to live. Got get him! I couldn't go into the careerI wanted to go into. And I couldn't do the thingsthat I wanted to do in my life. And I had tried all the diets. I had tried high protein,low carb diets, and just the whole good old fashionedworking out, and none of it worked. One day, my dad actually pulledme aside because he had had the surgery,my mom had had the surgery. I have a lot of people in my lifethat have had the gastric bypass surgery. And he told me thatit was an option. It was kind of like, my gosh, thisis something that's a viable option. >> I can actually do this. >> How are you? >> Fine, how are you? >> The most important piece ofadvice I would give somebody is to do what the bariatricteam tells you to do. >> Maintain your fluids. >> They tell you to get your64 ounces of water, and they tell you to get however muchprotein you're supposed to get in. You will be rewarded for it later. Are you okay? >> Yeah.>> You need to get out of bed, and you need to start walking becausethat's how the healing process starts to take place. Don't think that you can't get outthere and walk the day of surgery or the day after toa couple of days after. You'll be able to do whateverit is that you love to do. You'll be able to do that. It's not something that,this surgery isn't something that is going to keep you on the couch fora month. >> Today's topic is gonna be allabout hydration and it's probably the most important thing thatyou can do immediately post-op. >> You need to keepfluid going into you. So just have your bottleof water with you. Take little sips every now andthen, and you'll be good. You have limited realestate in your stomach. And you have to use that up withgood things like protein to help make you strong and keep your strength throughoutthe surgery process. The key thing there is youhave to get protein in first. No matter what else is around, nomatter what else is on your plate, you have to get your meats andfish and all that in. All your protein needsto get in first. Use them for snacks. Something high protein just to getthat little extra protein in every day, every chance that you can. The vitamins are a littlebit of a challenge. Sometimes I'll forget. I have this support system. I have my mom yelling at meevery day, get your vitamins in. I have my dad telling meto get my vitamins in. I'll set a reminder on my phone,get your vitamins in, your B12, your multivitamin, your vitamin C,all that kinda stuff. It's something that you need to dobecause this isn't just something that, you don't just get yourvitamins in for a month or two. It's something you have to do foryour whole life. Exercise by far,has been the biggest factor because it makes that scale tick downeven faster and that's a very, very cool thing to see,especially in the first year. You start seeingthings in your body, you start seeing these changeswhen the weight's coming off. You're gaining muscle and you're working out,it's an incredible thing to see. I would just say, don't be scared. This is the most rewarding thingthat I have ever done in my life. It is a blessing. It's a miracle and it's somethingthat I would go back and I would do tomorrow. I'm now able to be the personthat I was meant to be.	Low Medical Info

DTQSNLSfUgc	UC2uboRZzLsBHi9A_RqKxSOg	27.0	Gestational Diabetes: Diagnosis and Treatment	Because Gestational Diabetes typically doesn‚Äôt have symptoms, pregnant women are screened using a simple glucose tolerance test. Those at high risk will be screened earlier in pregnancy. Women are at greater risk for Gestational Diabetes if they have parents who had Type 2 Diabetes, are overweight, have had a large baby in the past, have sugar in their urine, have polycystic ovarian syndrome, or have had Gestational Diabetes before. In lower risk women, testing won‚Äôt occur until 24-28 weeks of a pregnancy. Complications of Gestational Diabetes include the baby becoming very large, causing a traumatic birth, and a higher lifetime risk for the baby of being overweight or developing diabetes themselves. Treatment of Gestational Diabetes typically involves a balanced diet and exercise, with medication only when required.

However, there are patients who are at greater risk. So a a woman whoseparents have had type 2 diabetes, or who is obese, or who has had a very large baby, orwho is spilling sugar in her urine, or who has polycystic ovarian syndrome or who's hadgestational diabetes before, those are all high risk conditions and those women we wouldtest for glucose tolerance as soon as we saw them in pregnancy. I mentioned that havinggestational diabetes greatly increases your risk of having type 2 diabetes and sometimeswomen will develop that type 2 diabetes between pregnancies and we want to know if that'shappened. Now for the average patient, we'll test them with a blood glucose testing whenthey get to be about twenty-four to twenty-eight weeks pregnant. And that's because the hormonalchanges of pregnancy are exerting their effects. They're increasing the resistance to the actionof insulin. And so if we're going to see glucose intolerance or gestational diabetes, it'llbe evident by twenty-four to twenty-eight weeks. The other point is if we test the patientsand we find they have an abnormal test and we treat them, we can prevent some of theadverse outcomes, which for gestational diabetes one of the biggest concerns is having a babythat's over ten pounds that can be very difficult to deliver and have a traumatic birth. Theother reason we want to avoid the babies getting too big and too fat is cause if they are toobig and too fat at delivery, they're more likely to grow up to be fatter as childrenand adults and they're also more likely to grow up to have diabetes themselves. So thetesting that we do includes, at about twenty-four to twenty-eight weeks, having the mother drinka sugary liquid and then measuring her glucose one hour later. If that's elevated, that screeningtest is positive, then we go on and we do a full three-hour oral glucose tolerance test.And if that's abnormal, then we begin treatment. And for most patients, treatment is goingto be diet, making sure that the patient has a balanced diet and doesn't eat concentratedsweets, candies, soda pop that's sweetened with sugar. Eats a balanced diet where mostof the carbohydrates come from complex carbohydrate sources and we also encourage the moms toexercise. Brisk walking every day will help to reduce her glucose levels and reduce thechances that she'll need to go on to additional therapy. And some patients, and it variesfrom patient to patient, but overall about twenty to thirty percent of patients, despitefollowing the diet, will have glucose levels that are too high and we know that becausewe also have the patients monitor their glucose levels using a glucose meter usually aboutfour times a day - when they get up in the morning and then after each meal. And if thoselevels are too high, if the pattern of those tests demonstrates they‚Äôre too high, whichcould be dangerous for the baby and lead to that baby being too big, then we would startadditional therapy. It might be an oral hypoglycemic, a pill, or it might be insulin.	High Medical Info

first off my name is Chloe and I'm having the gastric sleeve surgery I have a child I really didn't think that I was different like I didn't really think that I had a weight problem it started when I turned 12 13 14 those preteen two teenage years that I really was like well I don't look like everybody else so that's when I kind of thought yeah I have a problem there is a problem most of these patients realize that the problem is not only their weight many of them deal with the social challenges that that go along with being very heavy and overweight most of these patients really come to the realization that what they're doing is really designed to improve their quality of life their health and extend their longevity she's not-- understands that she's young you know she has a long life to live and so I think it was important for her to put her health as a priority it was definitely a lot of self-awareness and just thinking about what I wanted to do with my life and the things that I want to do that my weight would be a barrier the information meeting that I came to I was 18 I was so excited because I was like I'm gonna have surgery and I'm gonna get skinny and I'm gonna be healthy I might become an outpatient um that's when it made me realize that I'm gonna actually have to do some work to get this surgery and the typical patient that comes to Nationwide spend anywhere from six to eight months going through the analysis process while we're learning about the patient and figuring out what unique health problems they may or may not have the patient is also undergoing a pretty intense education educational process whereby they really are learning what the challenges are of going through a bariatric operation and assuming the lifestyle of someone who's undergone this type of operation this basically to see what I know basically wondering if I paid attention at all and information visions there has to be specific changes that they do make in order for them to be successful long term so I have my cup of water and then my two scoops of protein you know your nutritionist will tell you that protein is the most important thing for you to get and and you have to do it shake in the last two months when it what I was getting so more and more excited because this is happening and my doctors were like pumping me up didn't handle like that okay so this has been I've been waiting eight months to get my before picture taken you know it's those kind of moments and it's like yeah I didn't want to do this like people do care I'm a little nervous but you know I am more excited yeah cuz you know is always by the next time this happens surgery will be over today is the day it is to 105 in the morning of my surgery I am off set and ready I have about seven hours until I go under the night I think I was more nervous about what was gonna happen after surgery like how my body was gonna change and how people are gonna treat me isn't the way I look really going to affect how I am as a person and then what's your sleep yeah Chloe is getting a what's called a vertical sleeve gastrectomy and that operation involves removing about 80% of the stomach and turning the stomach into a tube or sleeve how's it going all right I'm ready for this just like I have anticipation for this the way this works is instance we're using the robot today you have to compensate for time so the actual time in the operating room is roughly about three hours two and a half to three hours the actual operation is about half that time I'll see you shortly she looks great she looks really enthusiastic I have my mom she's my main supporter she's one who's been helping me do this whole process she's always there for me she says she wasn't nervous but I could tell that she was nervous patience definitely her choice in terms of whether or not they want to undergo a bariatric operation with her without the assistance of the robots and so far most families have been very accepting and interested in using that kind of technology the big difference is that instead of a surgeon holding the instruments the robot is holding the instruments and the surgeon is controlling the robot from a separate computer console it allows the surgeon a little better visualization in the operating room so it makes the surgery a little bit easier from the standpoint of the surgical team and I think also the patient's themselves probably benefit from a little bit less discomfort post-operative thing for Chloe especially it's just getting a fine balance of you are going to eventually have a much better and healthier life because of this change these kids see weight come off and initially a lot of their weights going to come off because of surgery there will come a point in time that that weight loss slows down and stops and surgery is just a tool you know it has to work in conjunction with diet and activity changes and if we don't use that tool we can easily go back to our old lifestyle regain a lot of our weight so this is the first time she's had a major surgery so something that's going to affect her all right I think she could be a great role model for a lot of people I thought it's going to be a cakewalk going through surgery I didn't think it was a really big surgery I was like all I'm having is like a portion of my stomach taken out how big of a deal is that it was rough a lot harder that lot of these okay well this is Chloe's first video since having the surgery and I told her it was important that everybody know what they're getting into so how are you feeling right now but what am I doing wrong but everything I just try to remember got this to show paths that yes and this was seem like nothing in a couple of months it was all worth it I was an inpatient for three days pretty yeah I was kind of nervous I was like what's gonna happen when I go home and I feel something that I didn't feel in the hospital you know following surgery they do have a two to three month wall and working towards progressing back towards regular foods those four weeks were brutal and I don't like it I don't like that I can't eat what I want anyone to and I'm having all these bad craving for you bad for you creeping 'he's like i want fried chicken why why is this whole process really hard Chloe will be the first to tell you she was ready to kill me about by week two to three that she wanted food and she couldn't have food yet and I just said we have to take our time we want to start adding foods back into our diet but we also understand that her stomach still needs to rest a little bit you know it's just gone through a major operation and so right now in her journey it's just a lot of making sure we're eating the right amounts of foods the other big part of my piece is making sure she's meeting all of her nutritional needs it has been two weeks and days since my surgery physically I am doing a lot better I'm my incisions are healing up a lot better I started school so that's really exciting hmm I'm finally on a schedule a good schedule that's like I don't have to worry about what I'm gonna do at school because I already have a plan already scheduled every day before I go to school I will prepare my snacks I would like drink my protein shake either in the morning or around my way there and my teachers are awesome they totally get it I will can whip out whatever I want and it's okay what we've seen time and time again after performing these types of operations is that once a patient has lost a significant amount of weight it's it's really a game changer and it really opens up a whole new world for them I think that this is something that shouldn't be taken lightly that you should be serious about it but I think that this is where like your life will change for the better I have been walking more oh I've been taking my dogs on lots of blocks and I've been trying to get at least two miles in I just have to remember there's a light at the end of the tunnel and I've finally seen that light there are things that I always thought that I wanted to do that I never thought that I could do because of my weight like horseback riding and hiking you know just thinking about the future and seeing the progress that I've made now and the progress that will come is like I will ride a horse one day and that's so exciting I feel very happy that I decided to have surgery I think I'll be able to do things that I never thought I would be able to do you	Low Medical Info

2 number 1 eggs the regular egg consumption may reduce the risk of heart disease in variety of ways guys eggs have been shown to reduce inflammation improve insulin sensitivity increase hdl which is your good cholesterol levels and change the size and shape of ldl which is your bad cholesterol according to a 2019 study eating a high fat low carb breakfast of eggs may help people with diabetes manage their blood sugar levels throughout the day so have breakfast have high fat breakfast every morning previous research has linked egg consumption to heart disease in diabetics but that's not true however a recent review of controlled studies discovered that eating 6 to 12 eggs per week as part of a nutritious diet for your diabetes did not increase the risk factors for heart disease in people with diabetes there you go some research also indicated that eating eggs may lower risk of stroke hello everyone if you are looking for exclusive deals some blogs educational content every week delivered to your email subscribe to our newsletter at sugarmds.com right now number two greens with leaves now green leafy vegetables are high in nutrients and low in calories tada no surprise right but they are also low in digestible carbs or carbs absorbed by the body so they won't affect blood sugar levels significantly now many vitamins and minerals including vitamin c are found in spinach kale and some other leafy greens according to some evidence people with diabetes have lower vitamin c levels than people with ass diabetes and they may require more vitamin c through the diet most of the time vitamin c is a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory okay increased consumption of vitamin c rich foods can actually help diabetics increase their serum vitamin c levels while decreasing the inflammation and the cellular damage number three avocados avocados have less than one gram of sugar there are very few carbohydrates they have high fiber content and they're healthy fats so they even spike your blood sugar avocado consumption is also linked to a better overall healthy diet good diet quality as well as lower bmi yes weight loss avocados are therefore an excellent snack for people with diabetes especially since obesity increase the risk of developing diabetes if you didn't have diabetes that is still one of the best foods for pre-diabetics and insulin resistant people okay so it really helps prevent the diabetes in 2019 my study discovered that avocatin b or avob that's a fat molecule found only in avocados inhibits the incomplete oxidation in your skeletal muscle and the pancreas and as a result lower your insulin resistance now we know that more human research is needed when you're taking you know conclusions from the my studies but still there's a lot of evidence to show that evidence that avocados can help diabetes prevention number four legumes i know not everybody agree with that but beans are an inexpensive and nutritious and they're extremely healthy guys so beans are a legume that is typically high in b vitamins which you need minerals like calcium potassium magnesium and fiber which almost all diabetics need that in abundance they also have a very low glycemic index right which is essential for your diabetes management now beans may also help in what the diabetes prevention so if you're pre-diabetic or insulin resistant also eat beans in moderation of course in a study involving over 3 000 participants at high risk for cardiovascular disease those people who consumed legumes had a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes number 5 is chia seeds now diabetic patients will really love chia seeds if they try it right they are high in fiber and they are very low in digestible carbohydrates in fact 11 of the 12 grams of carbs in a 28 gram serving of chia seed fiber has no effect on your blood sugar levels now fiber can actually lower your blood sugar levels by how does the fiber do that by slowing the rate at which food moves through your gut and the way it's absorbed now chia seeds can help you maintain a healthy weight because fiber curbs hunger and makes you feel full chassis may also help in the maintenance of your glucose control all day long if you had headed for breakfast a study of 77 adults with overweight obese type 3 diabetics they discovered that eating chia seeds promotes weight loss and helps maintain your glycemic control chia seeds have also been shown to help lower blood pressure and inflammation markers number six on the list is oily fish what are they salmon which most people love sardines herring anchovies their little people love and mackerel some people love that too they're high in omega-3 fatty acids dha epa they're beneficial to your health especially when you have diabetes right so i would say eat wild caught salmon or farm salmon even if you know where they come from if you know the farm et cetera now getting enough of these fats on a regular basis is especially important for diabetics because you know they are predisposed to heart disease and stroke now dha and epa protect your cells that line your blood vessels your endothelial cells and reduce the inflammation in there and may help improve the arterial function according to a lot of research people who eat fatty fish on a regular basis have a lower risk of acute coronary events which is your heart attacks and your strokes they're less likely to die from heart disease even cancer again eating fatty fish may even help your blood sugar regulation just eating fish without changing anything now a study of 68 adults with you know with weight problems or obesity in that study they discovered that people who consumed fatty fish they had significantly lower post meal blood sugar spikes than those people who did not consume fish or did not like fish now fish also a great source of a high quality protein which keeps you full and helps to keep your blood sugar levels stable at least i will say five to eight hours after number seven is a greek yogurt now a long-term study that actually involved health data over a hundred thousand participants they discovered that eating yogurt especially greek yogurt on a daily basis was associated with an 18 percent lower risk of developing type 3 diabetes but it also can assist you in losing weight and keeping your blood sugar levels stable because of high protein and high fat content now yogurt and other dairy foods may help people with type 2 diabetes lose weight and you know of course improve the internal fat composition the visceral fat now yogurt also is what high in calcium right high in protein as we discussed and there is a type of fat called conjugated linoleic acid that can actually mill you feel fuller and longer now greek yogurt has six to eight grams of carbs per serving which is way lower than the regular yogurt so pay attention that you're actually eating greek yogurt again greek yogurt is high in protein so it will help you with the weight loss and and try to go with the full fat i don't really care if you know if you're not trying to lose weight you can go for full fat now nuts are the next they're tasty nutritious everybody loves them unless you have allergies to it and majority of the nuts contain fiber and they're low in net carbs as you know and some contain less carbs than the others now regular consumption of variety of nuts and i think my favorite knot is walnut and almonds they have been shown to reduce inflammation and lower blood sugar levels and avon sea levels which is a long-term three-month marker for a for blood sugar management they even lower your ldl which is your bad cholesterol now nuts may also help diabetics to improve their overall health because it helps with the ldl right so in a study in 2019 16 people with type 2 diabetes involved and they are eating you know peanuts like walnuts and almonds and hazelnuts and pistachios i love that too those people actually in that study when they ate those nuts they had a much lower risk of cardiovascular disease heart attacks and strokes and of course it's going to help your blood sugar levels if you're consuming nuts as a synagogue for example now another study with type 2 diabetes when people consumed walnut oil on a regular basis even that helped the blood sugar levels well that's really important because you know with the type 2 diabetes you frequently have insulin spikes or blood sugar spikes and you're always looking for something to snack on i think a nuts will be your best friend now broccoli is your number nine why is broccoli so important well because it's the most nutrient dense vegetables pretty much on the earth okay a half cup of cooked broccoli contains only 27 calories my friend and only three grams of digestible carbs so you can just eat as much as you want as well as like there's vitamin c and magnesium in there which is super important for your diabetes now broccoli may help with the blood sugar management for those reasons now one study discovered that eating broccoli sprouts literally reduce your blood sugar levels so if you didn't know that the food is medicine there you go broccoli you can use the medicine eat every evening with your regular meat with some meat dish or whatever is going to help you with your blood sugar levels now how this vegetable actually helps as a medicine because there's actually things that are there's some chemicals in there like sulforaphane for example they're found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and sprouts and so forth next one is gonna be extra virgin olive oil extra virgin olive oil contains something very important it's called oleic acid it's a type of mono unsaturated fat has antioxidant properties and it literally improves your glycemic control just like a medicine and it improves your not only your fasting but also post meal blood sugar and even triglyceride levels that's again important for people with diabetes because you know they're the one having difficulty with their blood sugar levels and the triglyceride levels most of the time at the same time now what else oleic acid does it actually stimulate a glp-1 hormone which is actually now used as a medicine so you can use olive oil as a medicine to improve your glp one function okay so you don't have to necessarily take a medicine to do that if you need a medicine in the medicine i'm not saying don't take medicine but you can use these foods for medicinal purposes for example in a large meta-analysis of 32 studies examining various parts of fat olive oil was the only one found to reduce the heart disease remember that polyphenols which are antioxidants are also abundant in olive oil now what does polyphenols do well they reduce inflammation they protect the cells lining your blood vessels again they protect you against the ldl cholesterol or oxidation of the ldl cholesterol and it also even help lower your blood pressure because extra virgin olive oil is unrefined it retains antioxidants and other beneficial features if you are trying to choose which olive oil you want to go for go for the extra virgin olive oil from a repeatable source again as many olive oils are most of them are blended with cheaper oils such as corn or soy oil so pay attention to that number 11 is flax sheets now flax seeds are known as common flax or linseeds or whatever you call it but they're high in heart healthy omega-3 fats and fiber and other unique plant compounds lignans for example which make up a portion of their insoluble fiber may actually help reduce the risk of heart disease which most diabetics die from and it actually helped improve blood sugar management as well now they did a review of 25 randomized trials they discovered a significant link between the whole flax seed supplementation and glucose reduction here you go another medicinal food for you now flax seeds may even help with your blood pressure reduction which is almost as important as lowering your blood sugar in 2000 study in a study with pre-diabetic for example consuming flaxseed powder on a daily basis reduced their blood pressure and improved their glycemic control and insulin resistance as well again don't expect this to happen overnight but if you're having in your diet for a while you're gonna see that we need more studies for prevention of diabetes but initial studies are indicating that the flax seeds are really good for your heart for your gut and for your diabetes again flax seeds contain a high amount of viscous fiber which improves your gut health insulin sensitivity and feelings of fullness which most of you i'm sure will like it right vinegar or apple cider vinegar so that's also a known topic but i'll explain a little bit uh both apple cider vinegar and regular vinegar actually have a lot of benefits not just lowering your blood sugar levels despite the fact that it is made from apples the sugar in the fruit is fermented into acetic acid so the finished product has actually less than one gram of carbs per tablespoon now data studies of course bunch of studies in the meta-analysis of these six studies involving over 300 people with type 2 diabetes found that the vinegar actually improves fasting blood sugar levels and eventually improves your a1c levels as well now other health benefits of apple cider vinegar include but not limited to antimicrobial and antioxidant properties and then we know that we need more research on this uh you can do more research definitely for this but we have a lot of benefits already proven now start with i will say two teaspoons of mixed in a glass of water which each meal incorporate apple cider vinegar into your diet we are coming up with our own apple cider vinegar gummies which is easier to consume but if you want to consume real vinegar then you may want to really dilute it and put some maybe lemon juice or something to make it more palatable i typically use it on my salads for most of my salads number 13 is are berries strawberries blackberries blueberries okay strawberries are they're high in anthocyanins which are antioxidants that give them that red color so if you're seeing a fruit that's colorful go for it okay polyphenols are beneficial plant compounds with antioxidant properties that are present in these berries in 2017 a study discovered that consuming polyphenols from strawberries and and cranberries for six weeks actually improved the insulin sensitivity in adults with overweight issues or obesity issues even when they did not have diabetes well that's really important because the insulin sensitivity or insulin resistance is a major issue that ends up causing the diabetes down the road and sometimes some people even end up with heart attack before they become diabetic due to insulin resistance now a cup of strawberries contain only 53 calories 12 grams of carbohydrates and three of that is basically fiber now this one serving also contains more than 100 percent of the recommended daily intake of vitamin c there you go just have some strawberries and you're good again some additional anti-inflammatory properties as well now of course we're going to talk about garlic right that's number 14. garlic is incredibly nutritious considering it is small size and low calorie count right so again garlic has been shown in many studies to help your glucose management your cholesterol regulation and even your blood pressure management one clove of garlic weighs around 3 grams that's it number 15 is squash well a lot of people love squash which is good right there are a lot of varieties of the squash of course but it's one of the healthiest vegetables available now it is dense it is a fling food it will fill you up and typically has low glycemic index and fairly low calories now acorn pumpkin and butternut squashes are winter varieties with a hard shell as you know and there is a summer squash that has a soft peel that is edible zucchini and italian squash are for example our most common varieties when it comes to that and squash like most vegetables they're high in antioxidants squash also contains less sugar than sweet potatoes so you can actually replace that instead of sweet potatoes right it's an excellent substitute now pumpkin polysaccharides which are found in the squash have also been shown in studies to improve the glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and of course lower serum glucose levels eventually although there has been not a ton of human research but as far as we know a lot of uh animal studies shows that squash actually can reduce your blood sugar levels relatively quickly now barrier melon is one of those that we use in our supplements which has the most highest potency in a concentrated form no wonder why we put in our supplement there now more human studies are needed to confirm that but again i would say squash is a safe bet for diabetics to get their blood sugar down now shirataki noodles are next shirtaki noodles are pretty excellent for dabbies and weight loss why well because these noodles are high in something called glucomannan glucomannan is a fiber derived from a konjac root we have other videos about this as well if you want to go back but this plant is basically grown in japan and processed into something called shritake it can be noodles or rice and like we said the glucomannan that's present in there is a it's a viscous fiber that makes you feel full and satisfied now in addition to that it has been shown to lower your blood sugar levels drastically after eating that and improve your risk factor for heart disease especially if you have diabetes or pre-diabetes or insulin resistance now there is a study for that as well now the glucomannan for example significantly decreased the fasting glucose serum insulin and cholesterol levels in diabetic rats shirtaki needles contain only 3 grams of digestible carbs and 10 calories per 100 grams serving these noodles typically packed with fishy smelling liquid some people don't like that but they must be thoroughly rinsed before the use and you will be okay i promise the noodles should then be cooked for several minutes typically in a skillet over high heat and so forth without any added fat to achieve that noodle like texture if you're into pasta and so forth well there you have it my friend i kind of came up with the 16 great foods that you should at least try look up some recipes and so forth and get it in place get in your diet i think you will love it again check out our website at sugarmds.com for more information and resources and guess what subscribe because you don't want to miss my next

These are two very important topics. If you happen to be following along with cards,I'm on card 23, and you'll notice the next four cards, there's a lot of bold and redtext on them, because there are several very important nursing concepts for you to knowrelated to these disorders. So both of these disorders have to do withADH, either too much ADH, not enough ADH, or the organs in your body aren't respondingappropriately to ADH. So let's do a quick review of ADH, and ifyou want more details about ADH, I did make a whole other video about it. But if you recall, ADH is released by theposterior pituitary gland in response to low blood volume in the body, low blood pressure,or to hypernatremia, or increased blood osmolarity. So if the body senses any of these three things,it will release ADH from the posterior pituitary gland, which will cause the kidneys to reabsorbmore water, which helps to bring up that blood pressure, bring up that blood volume, anddilute the blood so that the blood osmolarity is back to a normal level. So with diabetes insipidus, we have one oftwo things going on. We may have neurogenic diabetes insipidus,which means that there is some kind of injury or tumor in the hypothalamus or the pituitarygland such that insufficient ADH is being released from the posterior pituitary gland. So if the posterior pituitary gland is notreleasing enough ADH, the kidneys aren't getting the signal to reabsorb that water. So that is neurogenic diabetes insipidus. The other thing we may have going on is somethingcalled nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. So in this situation, the posterior pituitarygland is doing its job fine. It's releasing ADH. But there's some problem in the kidneys andthey are not responding appropriately to that signal. Right? They're getting the ADH but they're kind oflike, ""Ehh."" They're not reabsorbing more water. This may be due to some kind of kidney infection,or maybe the kidneys have been damaged due to nephrotoxic medications. But this is called nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. So in terms of signs and symptoms of diabetesinsipidus, the key symptom is that the patient will have large amounts of dilute urine. So we're just dumping water. We're just peeing out tons of dilute urine. We're not reabsorbing that water as we shouldbe. The patient will exhibit polydipsia, so thisis where they have excessive thirst. And one way that I remember this symptom,if you look at the word diabetes insipidus, diabetes inSIPidus will make you want to SIPmore water, because you're super thirsty. Other signs and symptoms include dehydration,hypotension, and anorexia. So in terms of labs, labs are definitely goingto be important to know. The urine, like we talked about, is goingto be very dilute. So the specific gravity of the urine willbe very low, or under 1.005. Also the osmolarity of the urine will alsobe very low, because it's very dilute. So it will be under 200, and then we wouldexpect kind of decreased sodium levels in the urine as well. In the blood though, that's a totally differentstory. Because we're getting rid of all those fluids,the blood's going to be really concentrated, so the serum, or blood osmolarity is goingto be over 300, and the sodium levels are also going to be really high, so we're goingto see hypernatremia. In terms of diagnosis of diabetes insipidus,we can do a water deprivation test to test the ability of the kidneys to concentrateurine. We can also do a vasopressin test. So vasopressin is essentially the same asADH. And if we give the patient vasopressin, wewould expect their kidneys to reabsorb water. If their kidneys don't do that, then we knowit's a problem with the kidneys and we have nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. If we give the patient vasopressin and theirkidneys do do their job and reabsorb water, then we know it was an issue with the pituitarygland not producing enough ADH. And if that is the case, then we can providemedications such as vasopressin or desmopressin, which you can find on Pharm card 110 in termsof getting more information about those medications. Alright. So in terms of nursing care, when a patienthas diabetes insipidus, we're definitely going to want to monitor the patient's eyes andnose, as well as their urine specific gravity and their daily weight. Alright. Let's move on to syndrome of inappropriateADH, or SIADH. With SIADH, we have excess release of ADHfrom the posterior pituitary gland due to a brain tumor, head injury, meningitis, orbecause of a medication. So even though the blood is very dilute, theposterior pituitary gland still releases ADH, even though it should not. So because it's releasing all this extra ADHinappropriately, it's causing the kidneys to reabsorb more water. So signs and symptoms of SIADH will includea very small amount of very concentrated urine. And then we'll have signs and symptoms offluid volume excess because we have all this extra fluid being reabsorbed. So the patient may exhibit signs and symptomssuch as tachycardia, hypertension, crackles, jugular vein distention, as well as weightgain. They may also complain of a headache, weakness,and muscle cramping. And then they may also exhibit confusion becausewe have hyponatremia due to all this dilution, and that can cause the patient to be confused. So one way to remember what SIADH does, ifyou look at the first two letters of that, S-I, you can think of super inflated, andthat's basically what happens. When you have SIADH, you reabsorb all thisextra fluid, and you are super inflated. Alright. In terms of labs, we're going to have, basically,the exact opposite as we saw with diabetes insipidus. So the urine with SIADH will be super concentrated. So the urine specific gravity will be elevated. It will be over 1.03, and the urine osmolalityor osmolarity will also be increased because it's so concentrated the blood or the serumwill be a completely different story. It will be very dilute, so the serum osmolalitywill be decreased. It will be under 270 and we'll see hyponatremiabecause the sodium is diluted with all this extra fluid volume. In terms of treatment, we're definitely goingto give the patient diuretics to try to get rid of some of this excess fluid. We can also give them a vasopressin antagonist,and then we can also give them hypertonic saline to help bring up the sodium levelsand allow for those electrolyte levels to be more in balance. In terms of nursing care, again, we're goingto want to monitor the patient's eyes and nose, we're going to weigh our patients daily,and we're going to restrict fluids and replace sodium as ordered by the provider. We're going to monitor for fluid volume excess. So if we have too much fluid volume overload,we can end up with pulmonary edema, which is life threatening. So we're definitely going to want to monitorfor that. And then we're going to want to continuallymonitor the patient's neurologic status because of the confusion that can result from hyponatremia,and we're also going to need to implement seizure precautions, because hyponatremiacan result in seizures if it gets too bad. Alright. So hopefully that was useful in terms of areview of diabetes insipidus, and SIADH. If you appreciated this review, be sure tolike our video and subscribe to us here. Take care."

am so excited to teach you more about how to use afresa the only ultra rapid acting inhaled insulin for adults living with type 1 or type 2 diabetes i know inhaling your meal time insulin is probably a new concept to grasp but together we're going to learn how to properly inhale in addition to watching this video please refer to the instructions for use found in your refrezza box or online before we start i want you to know that our team at afreza assist is always here to help you throughout your frezza journey so if you're concerned about affording your prescription want help navigating insurance or have questions after you try your first couple of frezza doses we can help you get the answers you need just give us a call patient support guides do not give medical advice but can help you organize specific medical questions for your doctor all right let's get started a phrase is an ultra-rapid acting inhaled insulin for adults living with type 1 or type 2 diabetes the insulin is a dry powder supplied in three color-coded cartridges which offer different size doses in addition to being color-coded these cartridges are clearly marked with the number of units at the bottom for example this is a titration box which includes blue cartridges containing four frezzo units green cartridges containing eight of reza units and yellow cartridges containing 12 of frezza units inside your box you'll find one small box which contains two of frezza inhalers foil packages each of which contain two blister cards of 15 insulin cartridges the foil packages and strips of cartridges are marked with the color and number of units and a printed medication guide and instructions for use before taking a frezza you'll want to review your notes from your last appointment to see what you and your healthcare provider discussed as an appropriate starting dose and what your target blood sugar range is like all insulin therapy you may need to work with your doctor during the first few weeks to adjust your dose up or down based on your blood sugar levels and how a frezza works for you now let's go through the instructions to properly inhale lafrezza which will look like this i'll break the inhalation down into four steps and walk through each one in detail step one select the cartridge because a frezza enters the bloodstream in less than a minute and starts controlling blood sugar in about 12 minutes you'll take a fresh out right before you begin eating once you open one of the foil packages you'll find two blister carts perforated to tear off into small strips of three insulin cartridges you'll first get your cartridge out of the strip by pushing the rounded plastic so that the cartridge breaks through the foil check the color and number on your foil strip or cartridges to ensure the correct dosage is selected step two load the cartridge after taking the inhaler out of its plastic wrapper you'll notice that there are two parts of the inhaler on the bottom there is a short flat broad purple base that will let you set the inhaler flat on the table if needed on the top there is a thin white mouthpiece that extends out longer than the base with a purple removable mouthpiece cover you can remember that the white part of the inhaler goes up towards the clouds you'll want to do the purple pinch to hold the base of the inhaler level while lifting the mouthpiece up to a vertical position this will open the inhaler you should see or feel a cavity inside which is where the cartridge will fit just like a puzzle piece you'll hold the cartridge with the white cup down and place it in the inhaler so the pointed end lines up with the pointed end in the inhaler next we'll close the top part of the inhaler back down you may feel or hear a snap that snap was the insulin cup sliding into position becoming like a salt shaker it's important that after this step to not turn your inhaler upside down shake it put it in your pocket or drop it as that could lead to a loss of powder so you'll want to do this step right before you're ready to inhale remember to keep the inhaler level once loaded step 3 inhale afresa now it's time to inhale take off the purple mouthpiece cover by pulling the very thin tab towards you before bringing your inhaler to your mouth exhale to get rid of the air that's already in your lungs then place the mouthpiece in your mouth with the inhaler tilted down towards your chin form a seal with your lips around the mouthpiece take a deep breath approximately three seconds like you would do a yoga breath or when your doctor is checking your breathing with a stethoscope once you've inhaled hold your breath for a couple of seconds or as long as is comfortable before resuming your normal breathing step 4 remove the cartridge once you're done open the inhaler remove the used cartridge and throw it away in regular household trash if your prescribed dose requires more than 12 units you will need to use more than one cartridge to get your right dose since the frezza is an inhaled powder it's not uncommon to experience cough at the beginning of your treatment in our clinical studies cough was a common side effect cough was mild and typically declined with continued use after one to four weeks as a suggestion taking a brezza at room temperature and having a sip of water before and after inhalation may help that said if you develop a persistent or reoccurring cough or have difficulties breathing while using a frezza contact your healthcare provider so just to recap using a frezza requires four steps step one select the cartridge for your dose step two load the cartridge into the inhaler step three inhale deeply through your inhaler step four remove the used cartridge and throw it away okay that's it if you have any specific medical questions please remember to ask your healthcare provider if you have additional questions about afrezza please schedule a training by calling us at afreza assist you've got this a frieza can cause serious side effects including sudden lung problems do not use a frezza if you have long-term lung problems such as asthma or copd before starting a frezza your healthcare provider will give you a breathing test to check how your lungs are working common side effects of a frezza include low blood sugar cough and sore throat these are not all of the possible side effects with the frezza tell your doctor if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away you are encouraged to report side effects of prescription drugs to the fda visit w www.fda.gov

Researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) found that, when diabetes patients consistently took glitazone medications, they were much less likely to develop Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD).

‚ÄúWe often hear about negative side effects associated with medications, but sometimes there can also be unintended beneficial effects,‚Äù said senior study author Ian Douglas, PhD, of LSHTM, in a press release.

While past research found that this might be the case for glitazones, this was the first study to confirm these findings in humans.

Vascular neurologist Roger Kurlan, MD, of Overlook Medical Center in Summit, NJ, told dailyRx News, ""Parkinson‚Äôs disease is not a strongly hereditary condition, so having a strong family history is unusual. It appears to be directly inherited for only about 5 percent of cases. Much research is underway to try to identify individuals who are indeed at increased risk for getting PD.""

'Glitazones' is the nickname for a group of drugs that are used to treat type 2 diabetes. Among these drugs are rosiglitazone (Brand name Avandia) and pioglitazone (Actos).

Parkinson‚Äôs disease is a progressive neurological disorder that causes shaking, rigidity, gait changes and dementia.

Researchers have found that patients on thesedrugs are much less likely to develop Parkinson‚Äôs disease. 'Glitazones' is the nickname for a group ofdrugs like Avandia and Actos. Parkinson‚Äôs disease is a neurological disorderthat causes shaking, rigidity, and dementia. It has no cure, but when doctors followedtwo groups of diabetes patients - one taking glitazones, the other a different anti-diabetesdrugs - they found a 28-percent lower incidence of Parkinson's in patients taking the gliatazones.

welcome to today's talk Tuesday the 7th of February now there's a public health emergency going on in most of our countries for example in the United States over 11 of the whole population is diabetic in the UK it's just over seven percent of the whole population is diabetic and this is associated with so many disease processes people are much more likely to die earlier much more likely to get heart failure renal failure cardiac cardiac problems like myocardial myocardial infarction so many risks associated with this diabetic blindness all sorts of problems and the evidence is now in as far as I can see on the protective effects of vitamin D it's not being done because it's dirt cheap and big Pharma can't make any money out of it so it's not being pushed but I'm going to give a meta-analysis this morning that shows a 76 level of protection between higher levels of vitamin D and lower levels of vitamin D so stick with this because it is a really quite huge International import and it's not it's not just in the Western countries this is all over the world India is terrible for diabetes for example first paper I'm going to look at is this one annals of internal medicine diabetes and risk for type 2 uh so basically this is people with uh pre-diabetes people that are going to develop diabetes in the next few years how can we stop them developing diabetes so um references there as always it's quite nice this one actually although uh unacceptably uh this paper is paper walled uh the annals of internal medicine do provide a nice summary for uh people uh well for for anyone to read sort of plain Language summary which of course is always good um vitamin D has many functions in the body including a role in insulin secretion and glucose metabolism so insulin of course is the hormone produced by the pancreas that lowers blood sugar levels now observational studies of Sona shown an association between low vitamin D levels and increased risk for developing diabetes so if we look at lots of people we find that the people with the lower vitamin D levels develop more diabetes but of course this is a correlation is it causal and that's what this study does it actually looks at three Interventional studies where vitamin D was actually given and the benefit was actually observed so this is an Interventional study it takes from takes it from observation which is a correlation which may or may not be related to actually demonstrating that no if we do improve vitamin D levels the amount of diabetes does go down so it's Interventional that's why this is so important so does giving vitamin D uh to people who are at risk of diabetes reduce the risk looked at three databases data going up to the ninth of December 2022 so pretty up to date compare the use of vitamin D versus placebo which of course is classic technique uh classic Interventional double-blind technique in adult in adults with pre-diabetes people that are going to develop diabetes often described as a sort of a glucose intolerance these people won't be diabetic now but without intervention they will be pretty soon a meta-analysis have pulled data now it's it's a three-year follow-up um so that's good and the vitamin D group the new one set of diabetes was in 22.7 of patients at the placebo group it was at 25 now it doesn't sound like a big difference but that translates into a 15 reduction when you look at the uh the figures so given the huge numbers that the tens of millions of people with diabetes this is absolutely huge 15 reduction but it actually gets better than that uh numbers needed to treat to prevent one case of diabetes is 30. so this means if we give 30 people with three pre-diabetes The increased amounts of vitamin D if we give them that as a supplement 30 people treated will prevent one case of diabetes Now that might not sound like much either but we've been looking at data recently for the uh the Autumn boosters for example for the uh covert mRNA vaccines and we found that you need some some cases tens of thousands and younger fitter people hundreds of thousands need to be treated to prevent one hospitalization so 30 as a number needed to treat is actually quite excellent especially as this is the study found this to be safe and especially as it's Dirt Cheap vitamin D can be bought from the supermarket for essentially nothing and we could make it a lot cheaper than that and give it out if we wanted to if the political will was there political will is not there of course because um politicians seem to be interested in uh making money and there's no money in vitamin D because of course it's out of patent uh reduced risk reduction by blood levels so people who had at least 125 Nano moles per liter and that's the same as a greater than 50 nanograms per ml uh compared to 50 to 74 Nana moles per liter so this is the higher group with higher levels this is the lower group with uh lower levels that's the vitamin D3 reduce the risk for Diabetes by 76 Hazard ratio 0.24 70 76 reduction this is absolutely huge 76 reduction for a simple cheap safe intervention of as as much as we can use the word safe it's a it's this study is certainly found to be safe very few people will have difficulties uh taking vitamin D of course I have to tell you to go to your doctor first um before taking anything don't take anything on my recommendations there are a few people people with sarcoidosis for example that can't take uh vitamin D but it is very rare most of us are deficient most of the time in Winters in the northern hemisphere um three year absolute risk reduction of 18.1 percent so this is the absolute risk reduction this is absolutely incredible looking at the whole population so the 76 percent um this uh 76 reduction was for people with pre-diabetes the absolute risk reduction for the whole population is 18.1 percent this is a massive benefit why is this not being done I believe it's negligent of the medical authorities not to do this because we have an absolute epidemic pandemics of diabetes now the dose used one study used 20 000 units of uh vitamin D3 a week call it calciferol per week 20 000 units a week and one study used four thousand units a day now personally I take 4 000 units a day that's a hundred same as 100 micrograms of vitamin D that's what I take personally and I also take a hundred micrograms of the K2 with it because the K2 sequesters the calcium released by the vitamin D and puts it into the bones and takes it out of the tissues so that's what I'm taking personally can't tell you what to take but that's what I'm taking uh personally 4 000 units a day um now another study took a 0.75 micrograms of a synthetic one but basically these are the sort of figures that we are looking at four thousand years actually four thousand units a day is not that high um of course it should be titrated on an individual basis but most doctors in the UK won't do vitamin D levels unfortunately mine won't unfortunately so we're left to guess that's why I guess that the best amount is probably four to eight thousand for me but because I'm a bit conservative and I don't know I just take four thousand if I was able to get the blood my blood levels tested as I should be able to but I can't but if we could then we could titrate that up or down a little bit I suspect I would need to titrate it up a bit but of course I don't know because I can't see my blood we need tests um I think if we want to spend money effectively on a public health intervention we should be testing the whole population for vitamin D levels that will be a really cost effective intervention whereas other massive Public Health interventions that are going on at the moment are less cost effective in my view adverse reactions um so they look for kidney stones high blood calcium how high calcium in the euro in the Euro and they didn't find it that didn't draw any definitive conclusions about safety because the numbers were so low so they didn't get an increase in kidney stones it didn't get an increase in this is hyper this is calcium in the blood and they didn't get an increase in calcium in the urine which is good their implications in adults with free diabetes vitamin D was effective in lowering the risk for developing diabetes the case is in my in my opinion made now why is this important let's look at data here from the Centers for Disease Control in the states so one in five people with diabetes don't know they have it let's look at the figures here this is by the Numbers CDC we're not great fans of the CDC of course but we assume they can collect diabetes numbers this is from uh total diabetes from uh 2001 to 2020 diabetes increased significantly amongst over 18s at the moment 37.3 million people have diabetes absolutely incredible 11 of the US population absolutely incredible now normally over 90 of these would be a diabetes mellitus type 2. dm1 diabetes mellitus type 1. that is the uh normally comes on when you're younger that's caused by a disorder of the pancreas with insulin deficiency whereas Diabetes Type 2 used to be called maturity onset but sadly a lot of people are getting it now and it's the Diabetes Type 2 that we're talking about so um 37 million people with diabetes 28.7 people have been diagnosed 8.5 million of diabetes have not been diagnosed and in this 8.5 million people in the states um they are developing pathology every day as a result of the chronic hyperglycemia in a country like the United States this is simply not acceptable 8.5 million of your citizens have diabetes and don't know it we'll see the UK is not a lot better in a minute um total pre-diabetes 96 million people so we can reduce that by 18 percent oh heck that's going to be about 50 million cases over the three year period and presumably over the next three years it'll be another 15 million cases prevented the economic costs uh 327 billion this was in 2017. um absolutely incredible for the individuals concern 9000 601 dollars per year and of course some people simply do not have this money massive economic costs now this the UK is not a lot better a bit better but not a lot these are the figures from diabetic diabetes at UK let's look at those in a bit of detail now as well um UK prevalence of diabetes 4.8 million that's seven percent of the population still quite incredible uh 3.9 million diagnosed that one million don't know they have it so one million people in this clever sophisticated the United Kingdom have diabetes is damaging their organs it's damaging their heart vessels it's damaging their kidneys it's damaging their eyes it's damaging their peripheral circulation and they don't even know they have it because no one's bothered to look this is quite uh ridiculous we should have public health screening for blood sugar levels and we should have public health screening for vitamin D levels um but it's lacking as far as these one million people are concerned and this is so so so simple you just do a finger prick to test for sugar I mean okay it's better to do blood levels for hpa1c for glycosylated hemoglobin um but it's a simple blood test why is this not being done um it's a real failure of Primary Health Care in the UK don't we care about our people or something what is what's going on here quite annoying really um it's going to go up to 5.3 million people by 2025. people with type 2 diabetes 50 more likely to die prematurely two and a half times more likely to develop heart failure horrible disease heart failure people with heart failure suffer terribly horrible disease twice as more likely to have a heart attack that's a myocardial infarction an MI twice as likely to have one of those factors now diabetes UK do stress obesity is the main factor but of course vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent in people that are obese because vitamin D is fat soluble it absorbs into the fatty tissues so when you give an obese person some vitamin D it doesn't go into the blood it goes into the fatty tissues so the way more short of vitamin D you have to supplement them with higher doses for longer to get the vitamin D levels up in the blood but eating too many sugars reading too many carbohydrates or eating too many processed foods we don't exercise enough and we don't get enough vitamin D or correctable but the vitamin D one is just correctable with a few tablets obesity is hard work cutting down on sugars is is a bit more complicated carbohydrates is a bit more complicated processed foods are just everywhere in a cheap one fortunately we need to eat a lot more fruit and vegetables especially a wide variety of plants and and more more fat containing food as long as it's not processed fats um but the vitamin D one it would be easy test the levels give a simple supplement and we would eradicate that variable and presumably reduce the risk by 76 percent with an absolute risk reduction for the whole population of over 18 this is absolutely huge and in my view it's a scandal that is not being done so there we go in my view it's now definitive intervening to give Vitamin D supplements reduces the development of type 2 diabetes over a three-year period thank you for watching	High Medical Info

For me it was a was a pretty long process... they weren't exactly sure for how long I was really diagnosed with type 1 diabetes because with mytraining I managed it somehow I don't know how, but really the year 2013 / 2014 I was really having a lot of trouble training and I actually decided to goback to school and things just really weren't working out well for me. I triedmy best to compete, I tried my best to you know have a social life, I tried mybest to train to really just live, but I wasn't getting the results that I wantedin my swimming career. That year 2014, I actually didn't qualify for a very biginternational competition called The Commonwealth Games, I actually placed fourthand wasn't selected unfortunately. For the 4 x 20 freestyle relay,and it also led me to a really long vacation in the summertime, I took around 2months off and that's when the symptoms really started to hit me hard I was... you know, thirsty all the timealways having to use the washroom and it even got so bad that I couldn't really see anything, things were things are really really blurry and Iwas losing a tremendous amount of weight and I just really had no energy, I wouldwant to go for just an easy 30 minute jog and things really weren't workingout and I was really really starting to get scared so finally in September,beginning of September, I decided to go and see my doctor and this was a familydoctor and to be honest she wasn't even sure if I had it because you know, no onein my family really has diabetes So she was like, I'm not sure but you know wait a day go get your blood test done and we'll seeafterwards. Obviously, being me, I said no way! I'm not going to wait a whole day.  I called my mom straightaway and I said: Mom, I started crying like the doctor thinksI might have diabetes, I don't know what's going on! And she said ok meet upwith me, we're going to go eat some lunch, then we're going to go to thepharmacy afterwards to go get your your sugar level checkedand that's exactly what we did and they couldn't even read the number on theglucose meter unfortunately... they told me to go straightto the hospital... which I did balling... I was crying so much but it wasokay, it was gonna be okay and you know it's going to be okay. I got to the hospital I... mysugar level was at 39, they had many questions for me that I could not answerbecause I really had no idea what was going on, I was really shocked, Iwas in the emergency room for a whole night, thankfully they letme leave earlier cause I was young I guess, I don't know, but it wasreally scary, I remember all those needles plugged into me all overthe place and my my boyfriend and my family seeing me like what's going onBarb! Like they were really freaking out It was a really scary time butI figured it all out in the end and with the doctors... they told me that Icouldn't even go back to training, that they weren't even sure if I shouldcontinue training but they also told me that I could live a healthy lifewhich I believed them, but I didn't believe them when they said you should continue swimming because Ididn't want to you know, Olympic year was coming up in not too long and I didn'twant to have to believe that. So three months after I was diagnosed Ijust decided to go back to training which was really really difficult! Ireally had to change a lot of things I had to check my sugar levels very veryoften, I remember my fingers were a little bit bruised at the end, they stillhave a few scars on them, but you know things are really working out and that'swhen I... you know, I slowly got interested in the Medtronic insulin pump and I workedwith the nurses at Medtronic and they were so amazing! They absolutely saved me! That's exactlyhow I feel honestly, they were always there for me and if I had any questionsthey jumped on it straightaway and they're amazing! Honestly.I really appreciate their help and everything so, I'm really thankful.	Low Medical Info

cajun stork here what happens when you fail your one hour glucose tolerance test i want to talk to you about what happens when you fail what the next steps are and what alternatives you might have to those next steps in today's video but before i begin my name is midwife kyrah and i believe in truly natural birth because i know that it makes for better birth experiences consider subscribing to my channel and don't forget to join in the conversation in the comments below and if you look in the description below you will find a link to my pregnancy complaint kit that i've made just for you now i know that if you're watching this video you're probably feeling really stressed right now because you may have failed your one hour glucose tolerance test this does not mean you have gestational diabetes so let's start there the one hour glucose tolerance test is simply a screening test it lets us know we need to screen you more for a diagnostic test which is the three hour glucose tolerance test in general if you fail the three hour glucose tolerance test you are given the diagnosis of gestational diabetes and even at that point just so you know that does not mean that you have to be on medication but it does typically mean you will have to see a high-risk doctor at some point for a nutrition consult now in midwifery care we do things a little bit different first of all when you fail a one hour glucose tolerance test the first thing you should know is what number did you fail it by now typically in a one hour glucose tolerance test there's a range given by your health care provider on what a pass or a fail is if you're one point above that range you fail if you're one point below that range you pass as a midwife that makes no sense to me i don't believe that gestational diabetes is a yes or a no is a continuum it is a level of sugar intolerance so by failing your one hour gtt as a midwife i recognize that this means you might have a sugar intolerance but that does not mean you're diabetic and we need to take a closer look now depending on the number you got on your test will depend on the next steps for a mom who severely failed her test this would be a reading of 140 or above then what i would do is recommend that she go ahead and take her three hour glucose tolerance test as an alternative though to the three hour test you can actually do two weeks of home monitoring with a diet log and a glucometer now i have a video on this i'm gonna go ahead and post right here about how to monitor your glucose levels at home in case you're already at that state when you're watching this video but basically you'll be taking your fasting levels along with either one or two hour after meals three times a day after meals for two weeks and this lets us know it gives us like a sneak peek into your diet on whether or not you have good sugar control based on your particular diet i have had tons of moms fail the one hour glucose tolerance test to find out that they are already intuitive enough to know that they don't eat a lot of sugar they know it makes them feel bad and when you look at their diet their glucose levels are cool as a cucumber no pun intended well maybe a little so the next steps of either two hour monitoring or three hour glucose tolerance test are both options if you failed let's say by one point five points or ten points i strongly encourage my mamas in my practice to go ahead and do two weeks of home monitoring first before we put their body through that trial of the three hour glucose tolerance test why well unlike the one hour test which is 50 grams of sugar or as you've seen in one of my other videos is equivalent to like fasting and eating a snickers bar and drinking a coke the three hour glucose tolerance test is not 50 but 100 grams of sugar 100 grams of sugar that is 16 and a half teaspoons of sugar for a woman who is already at risk of actually having gestational diabetes so in my practice i really like to reserve this actual test for women that i just truly need to know and a two week home monitoring may not be enough now as a side note what you should know is if you failed your one hour glucose tolerance test with a result of 200 or above you automatically are given the term or the diagnosis gestational diabetes and you will have a consultation with a maternal fetal medicine this again does not mean you're going to end up on insulin necessarily however i do have to say for my moms who have two hundreds on their tests they tend to end up on medications but it does mean that you're gonna need a little bit further evaluation and possibly an extra level of care are there any other alternatives to the three hour test or two weeks of home monitoring i'm not really familiar with any and i'm pretty experienced in dealing with gestational diabetes both as a passion of mine but also as a midwife who deals with nutrition counseling very often in my practice and so i'm not really sure that there's any other viable options out there but if there are i want you to go ahead and post them in the comments below and i'll do some research on them and maybe post a later video do you have any other questions about what happens after you feel the one hour gtt or glucose tolerance test if so post them in the comments below but otherwise i'll see it one of my other midwife monday videos

really need to know because if you don't know these things you will be totally misled about a1c so you better know these facts today in this video that's going to only take a few minutes so remember to subscribe give it a thumbs up and share this video if you like this and remember knowledge is the power i'm dr ahmed erik i'm an endocrinologist and a diabetes expert and today we are talking about hemoglobin a1c so guys remember to take the quiz make sure you watch the entire video you will win a chapter from my diabetes book you may win any chapter from my diabetes but it could be a chapter one chapter two chapter five so and if you keep taking these quizzes you're going to end up winning the entire book which is a 25 value for you so let's get started so guys if you watched my previous avonc videos just like this one or that one or this one we make a1c videos why because a1c is the most important test in diabetes and that is the test that you always discuss with your doctor so when your doctor says to you everyone says nine percent and you're like okay so what because you don't know what it is right or your doctor says you don't even see seven percent you're like yeah i'm down to seven i'm like okay so what are you happy about they're like i don't know from nine to seven sounds good to me well you better know a little bit more now as you all know the event c is average blood sugar it's a percentage we look at the hemoglobins how sticky how sugar-loaded your hemoglobins are and what's hemoglobin well hemoglobin is the basic molecule in your red blood cells that carry the oxygen and when they are stuck with too much glucose we call them glycated we can tell how high your blood sugar is we have a mathematical calculation about your average blood sugar so it's just a scientific things you know so the thing is now if you're for example your average blood sugar is 150 your a1c is around seven percent so here's the deal if your doctor says your avonce is seven percent but your blood sugar is running in the two hundreds you should ask yourself is that really good or is my avonci correct so what's wrong because i know as a patient because i am an educated patient doctor you better know your patient so i am educated because i know that a1c may not be right or it may be the other way around your doctor may say that your avon c is like nine percent but your blood sugars are in the low 100s 80s 90s it never goes up you can be like doc what are you talking about you know my a1c is it doesn't make any sense because my blood sugars are so good in my fingers so so which one is incorrect is it your finger sticks are incorrect is your avon c incorrect well here's how to find out look at your cdc okay so cbc shows your blood count in that blackout you have to look at your hemoglobin it's generally abbreviated as hb or hematocrit abbreviated as hct sometimes if you're a hemoglobin and hematocritus off the chart you know you have a problem right certain ethnicities also may have a carrier status of certain disorders like blood disorders like thalassemia for mediterranean descent skill cell anemia for african-american descent sometimes they are carriers and they have some abnormality in their hemoglobin variants because we have different various variants of hemoglobin in our blood and we assume when we do a test we just assume that you're just normal like everybody else but you may not be that normal person you may not even know also if you're anemic for example if your hemoglobin is down to 10 or 11 that makes a huge difference if you are treated versus untreated anemia that also makes a huge difference so so what difference does it make so if you are anemic right so your body is not really making new cells new red blood cells new hemoglobin so your majority of your red blood cells are full of the old ones now what happens when you get old you carry a lot of stuff you know you accumulate a lot of stuff same thing with the red blood cells they accumulate a lot of red blood cells and when there is no youngsters coming in it looks like you know your hemoglobin is very high in a false way now what happens when you get treated let's say your iron deficient your b12 deficient and you start treating this and then suddenly your body starts making all these young red blood cells and suddenly your blood is full of youngsters now they don't carry the glucose because again we are measuring the average of three months and then when we sample your blood and if you sample a bunch of youngsters hemoglobin since of the older ones not a good mix then we are going to be misled thinking that your hemoglobin a1c is good but actually it is not because you know all these young river the blood cells are not exposed to glucose so we are assuming when we test you that you have a regular 120 day cycle of every red blood cell but again if you're anemic and your cells do not have an average of 120 days then you will have falsely high or falsely low numbers so if that's the case you always question and discuss with your doctor hemoglobin a1c may not be the best test for you if that is the case so what are the other tests well there are other tests you can use after discussing with your doctor such as fructosamine such as glycomark and there's some other like tests that are out there depending on the country you're in but the in the united states we mostly use for dosamine and glycomark glycomark test you cannot use if you're on sglt2 inhibitor such as guardians farsiga or invokina type of drug but fructosamine can show your last two to three week blood sugar spikes and that may be helpful as well i know a lot of insurance companies are judging you or your doctor or your doctor is judging you everybody's judging everybody right you should have a quotation or notation in your chart saying that this patient's a1c is not valid because of this and this so i hope this was helpful guys remember to take the quiz and it's in the description below check it out and we will see you in the next video and before that give a thumbs up share and like this video guys talk to you later hey guys i hope you are enjoying this channel so far and i hope you subscribed already if you didn't do it and if you did watch this video right there i think that will help you too	High Medical Info

Pl28IILPDTU	UC-C8ctdM277CcDXXa9W7yXQ	22.0	How to do an Insulin Injection	"The video teaches how to properly use an insulin pen to manage blood glucose levels, including choosing the right needle size, injecting at the correct angle, rotating injection sites, and using the pen's memory function to track injections.
Produced by the UCLH children and young people's diabetes service."	22500.0	PT6M12S	2d	hd	False		0.0			1310741.0	6623.0	0.0	59.0	2011-08-24T08:34:58Z	University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust	6879403.0	I'm going to show you how to do an insulin injection you're going to be doing an insulin injection whenever a child has something to eat where you're matching the insulin to the food that they're eating or when their blood glucose level is high and you're giving extra insulin to bring the blood glucose level back down to the target range I'm going to show you how to use an insulin pen there are different insulin pens to fit different insulins this pen is a nuovo pen echo and it fits novo insulin so novo rapid and lever Mir insolence when you take the lid off the pen you can see that this pen is refillable with insulin already inside the pen each insulin has a different color on the top of the pen so that you can always recognize have you got the right insulin this is a demo pen so it's white but your pen will have a color if you look in the window you can also see a bung and that bung gives you an indication as to how much insulin you've got left in the pen so the bung is here so I've got this amount of insulin still left to go your insulin pen can be kept at room temperature it can be kept at room temperature for one month spare insulin needs to be stored in the fridge before proceeding with the injection you need to make sure your hands are clean so wash your hands before you start now you've washed your hands you're going to put a new needle on the pen device there are different sized needles and the needle lens that you use will depend on your child and that needs to be a conversation with your healthcare team this needle is a four millimeter needle which I'm going to demonstrate you peel off the end and then this pushes and twists on the end of the pen device twist until you can't tighten it any further take off the clear plastic lid and then being careful take off the needle cover before you perform any injection you need to always perform what we call an air shot you're pushing a small amount of insulin through the needle to get rid of the air if you forgot to do this your next injection dose would be much less than you thought you were giving looking at the pen you can see a dial with numbers on it on this particular pen each line is equivalent to half a unit and when I turn the dial you'll hear clicks each click is equivalent to half the unit so I'm going to dial up four clicks which is two units for an air shot I've dialed four with a needle facing the ceiling I'm going to push on the end of the pen and you expect to see some insulin escaping from the needle if you don't see anything coming at the end repeat the process again with another two units as an air shot having done that you're now ready to give the injection places that you can do your insulin injection will depend on the age of the child and their own preference but sites include the arm around the back of the arm the tummy if you imagine your belly button a happy smiley face around the belly button is where you can do the injection the legs on the outer aspect of the size and the buttocks and each child will have a preference as to where they have their injection the important point is that the sites get rotated so you don't use the same place for every single injection if you do that there's a chance that the injection sites could become very lumpy and the insulin would stop working having decided where you're going to do the injection you now need to give the insulin injection so I'm going to use this injection device to demonstrate so picking up your pen you need to remember to dial a number of units that you're going to give so I'm going to dial and of Units here you don't need to use what we used to refer to as a pinch up technique where you hinge the skin and then inject because the needles are so small that there isn't a worry about them going too deep so you're going to go in at a 90 degree angle and then once you've injected into the skin move your thumb to the end of the pen and push down once you've pushed as far as you can go you're going to delay removing the needle for a count of 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 at this point you can take the needle away from the skin and you've done your insulin injection to remove the needle from the pen do not put the small needle cover back on because of the risk that you'll cause injury to yourself instead use the plastic cover and carefully place it back on the pen and twist off and then the needle can be disposed of in your sharps box put your pen lid back on and you've done your insulin injection now some pen devices have memories on the end so this particular pen has a memory on the base of it so if I pull the lid out and then push it back in it will tell me the number of units that was last injected and also how many hours ago it was given so that can be a helpful reminder if you can't remember when you last gave an insulin injection	High Medical Info

Peripheral neuropathy is a common condition that I see every day in my office. It's also one of the most frustrating conditions to have and to treat. My name is Dr. Andrew Schneider, and I'm a podiatrist in Houston, TX.
Peripheral neuropathy is nerve damage that affects the extremities, both the hands and the feet. 

There are many causes of peripheral neuropathy. Too many to count. That's part of the problem with treating it. The most common causes include diabetes, aging, vitamin deficiencies, chemotherapy, alcoholism,
smoking, and some medications. 

Let me also be clear, that in some cases, peripheral neuropathy is caused by the aging process. While we can help calm the symptoms, we don't have the fountain of youth. In fact, if a nerve is completely damaged, there's no way for it to regenerate.

The reason that peripheral neuropathy usually starts in the toes is due to the simple fact that your toes are the farthest point from your brain. Your brain receives impulses from the nerves and translates that into sensations. From your feet, all the way to your brain...that's a long way to go and plenty of opportunities for things to go awry. 

Nerve pain comes in different forms. Some people feel a numb sensation. Others feel a burning and tingling sensation to varying degrees. Some feel pain so intense that it feels like their feet are on fire. 

It's important to differentiate nerve pain from other causes of pain. If your feet are hurting, when you're standing and walking, that's usually a musculoskeletal pain such as tendinitis. If the pain primarily occurs when you're off your feet, such as when you're laying in bed at night, it's more likely to be nerve pain. To further muddy the waters. If you are pain-free when you go to bed, but you're awakened by your feet being in intense pain, this can be due to a circulation issue.

Some topical treatments do help nerve pain using a topical analgesic that contains menthol or capsaicin. There are many such products available over the counter. These analgesics work to provide another stimulus and essentially confuses the nerves as they send impulses to your brain. This can help reduce the pain you are experiencing from peripheral neuropathy. Many people have found relief using topical CBD preparations.  

As I said, the pain you're feeling is often due to a combination of factors. Nerves travel along with other structures, such as tendons. If the tendons swell, it puts pressure on the nerves and can increase the nerve pain. That's why stretching, which is helpful to mobilize the muscles in tendons, helps to reduce the pain from the nerves. 

If your foot flattens when you stand, that causes the nerves to stretch and become painful. Wearing insoles or custom orthotics to support the foot can also take pressure off the nerves and reduce the associated pain. Don't minimize how something so simple and approachable can make a difference in the pain you are feeling. 

Nerve pain is also linked to circulation problems. When there's not enough blood flow to the nerves, they're deprived of oxygen and increase in pain. Massaging your calf and thigh helps increase the blood flow. Compression hosiery also provides support to the circulation. If you can increase your circulation, you'll often find some relief from nerve pain. Also, it is essential that you don't smoke. Smoking is one of the most preventable risk factors and can lead to poor circulation. 

If you're in a situation where you feel like your feet are on fire, we can deaden the nerves with a topical lidocaine cream or patch. Some medications treat nerve pains such as Lyrica and Gabapentin. The problem is that these medications have significant side effects. 

If you're diabetic, the best way to lessen the nerve pain is by getting your blood sugar in good control. It's not an easy thing to do, but it is worthwhile to minimize the side effects of diabetes, including peripheral neuropathy. Taking medication or insulin is not enough. You need to control your diet to lower your blood sugar. 

Finally, sometimes peripheral neuropathy is caused by a physical impingement of the nerve. If I suspect that that's the cause I'll refer you to a neurologist who can measure the nerve impulses as they travel to your feet. Sometimes physical therapy can help a nerve impingement. Other times you may need surgery to free up the nerves.

today he's meeting a world leading expert on the condition professor Roy Taylor journey Paul's always been told that his diabetes is incurable and that he would need a lifetime of medication to manage the condition but Roy's research offers a new hope we've discovered the precise cause of type 2 diabetes fat is really gumming up the works and if we can remove fat we can reverse diabetes type 2 diabetes is a condition where your body struggles to control your blood sugar levels this can lead to amputation blindness kidney failure and heart disease Roy's breakthrough is to discover that the condition is caused by a buildup of fat in two specific organs the liver and pancreas so he's putting Paul through an MRI scan to find out how much fat he has in those organs a color-coded scan reveals how much fat is inside Paul's liver to be healthy it should be less than 5% the red dots show the fat these brightly colored dots show your liver fat to be over 10% now that's over twice what it should be too much fat in the liver can spread to cause bigger problems this fat doesn't just stay there part of what the liver does normally is to pass out fat to the rest of the body one organ that'll take it up is your pancreas the pancreas produces insulin the hormone that controls our blood sugar levels [Music] it's the fat in the pancreas that stops the insulin producing cells doing their business because they're crowded in by the fat we take away the fat potentially we can do something about it we can reverse diabetes Paul's not worried about his health for his own sake he wants to be healthy for his wife to have a desire to live longer Andrea the wife plus multiple sclerosis and it's not getting any easier for her though you know I need to be alone to look after their in a recent trial using crash diets professor Taylor saw nearly half of the volunteers reverse their diabetes after a year there's no way of knowing whether this will work for Paul but to stand any chance he needs to stick to the diet I love the short strawberry cheesecake please my wife ever resisted many temptations and hopefully I'm determined enough to resist the temptation to cheat on this this diet because the only person I will be cheating is myself Paul is in Blackpool with his wife Andrea and their grandchildren surrounded by the kind of tantalizing treats which would test anyone's resolve that looks really tasted up those I'll have to pass it on have I been a bit dumb thing I haven't loved being dumped it yeah yeah be honest a hunter so you've got your ice creams and I'm sucking my thumb [Music] Paul is reaching breaking point yesterday I did feel quite close to packing it in I just felt it subtle enough after just four weeks Paul has hit Susan's to stone weight loss target so he's returning to Newcastle to find out if that's helping with his diabetes he's having a second MRI to look at whether the condition of his liver and pancreas has improved and professor Taylor has the results oh now come on have a seat four weeks ago Paul's liver contained more than 10% fat to get his liver back to normal he needs to have cut that by half if we look here yes you can actually see a difference here so the targets five and this is what we're seeing three point nine oh my goodness you've had a huge change in your liver your liver is a new order in just four weeks Paul has gone from having a liver in critical condition to it being healthy again but that's only part of the story even more crucial is whether the level of fat in his pancreas has come down enough when we started off the pancreas fast was eight point seven now we've gone down from eight point seven to eight point seven percent doesn't feel a great deal that's because the pancreas is entirely different it's meant to have some fat in there and that fats going to stay there it may not seem like much but one of the biggest discoveries from Roy's research is that just a tiny reduction in fat in the pancreas can correct the cause of diabetes in all our studies over eight weeks people lose on average about one percent and it's that one percent that allows the insulin producing cells to wake up now you're well on the way to that [Music] Paul's results are very encouraging but he will only be certain if he's finally beaten this killer disease when he goes back to hospital for a full blood sugar test in a month's time Paul was recently diagnosed with diabetes and is facing a lifetime on medication to cope with it he's about to get the results of a blood sugar test which will tell whether he's beaten his diabetes Sherlock fleas have been desperate to see him so this is the normal zone this is the pre-diabetes and Ready's diabetes you're way short of the diabetes zone your diabetes has gone into remission it's worked squirt that's the main news of the day and I'll be leaving there there's good news so Sherlock know Paul once thought his diabetes was incurable but he's now free from it and if he keeps the weight off he reduces the risk of it ever coming back I couldn't quite believe that the dream was gonna carry on and I thought no you're gonna you're gonna be that person that doesn't benefit from it what no yeah you really have you really have you know do this for Antonia so--but effort I don't want to see these grandchildren grow old because they're in arts of things well done Paul gonna be a real inspiration to so many people you	High Medical Info

I'm amedical doctor boarded in internal medicine and family medicine and Istarted Post Script to make sure people just like you have access to clearunderstandable information about their healthcare I'm here today to talk aboutthe top five side effects one of the most frequently prescribed medicinesmetformin which is also known by its brain name glucophage you're probablyhere after getting prescribed met Foreman and you're looking for a wellexplained to overview well you're in luck because as someone who deals withmetformin every day in my career I'm here to lay it out so anyone canunderstand but before we get to the top five side-effects of met for men we haveto have a good understanding of the main disease metformin treats diabetes now ingeneral the disease we call diabetes happens when your body can no longerkeep sugar levels under control and now you have too much sugar floating aroundin your blood that overload of sugar can long-term mess up your eyes your nervesyour kidneys your heart and also make you prone to things like infections andstrokes to help you get diabetes I've got an analogy for you think of the lasttime you lifted weights hopefully that's happened at least once in your life getto the gym the first time you lift that weight you feel strong you feel like youcan lift it all day but the more and more you lift it each time it gets alittle harder until that weight that you once could lift easily you can no longerlift sugar in your body is similar when you eat food sugar goes into your bellyand to make sure you don't get too much of that sugar a organ called thepancreas right in this area it releases a chemical called insulin which tellsyour body to store and process the sugar well just like lifting weights the firsttime the pancreas sees that sugar it's easy it pops out some insulin and thesugar is taken care of but what if you're constantly throwing sugar intoyour body well that sugar lowering pancreas isvery similar to your tiring muscle as it deals with sugarover and over it gets more and more tired until eventually it's just like Igive up I'm not dealing with the sugar anymoreand at that point it stops releasing enough insulin to keep the sugarcontrolled in your body if your blood sugar gets mildly out of control we callthat pre-diabetes but once your body is constantly overrun with sugar that'swhen you're diagnosed with diabetes now diabetes happens when blood sugargets too high it makes sense that most diabetes medicines work by trying todecrease sugar in some way and there are a few basic options to do this a lot ofmedicines are aimed at increasing insulin which the pancreas got tired ofmaking a metformin that we're here to talk about is a different idea insteadof worrying about insulin metformin looks at other sources of sugar in yourbody and what's the main source of sugar besides food the liver also in this areayour liver is constantly making sugar this is so that if you somehow gotstranded on an island and you're starving your liver would kick intooverdrive and make sugar to fuel your body well this is exactly wheremetformin attacks it shuts down your livers ability to make new sugarin addition metformin can stop your belly from absorbing as much sugar afteryou eat less sugar absorb means less sugar in your bloodstream it also seemsthat metformin has other more complicated ways to keep sugar undercontrol like insulin sensitization which is basically taking the insulin that'salready in your body and making sure it gets put to the best use but enough ofthat now that we know how metformin works we can understand how it causesthese top five side-effects side effect number five lactic acidosiswhat okay this one's a little scary which is why it's the feared black boxwarning of metformin but it's very rare it basically means that metformin couldcause too much acid in your body this is because metformin can very slightlyincrease your acid levels specifically lactic acid people have usually heard oflactic acid because the one that builds up in your bodyafter you exercise that causes that burn you get when you're working out wellmetformin just barely increases lactic acid levels to levels that are stillsafe so this isn't usually a problem unless all of a sudden you get anotherissue that also causes a slight increase in acid for instance you're takingmetformin and then your kidneys get damaged or you're taking metformin andyou get severely dehydrated or septic or very sick now you have a double whammyand you could get sick from the acid buildup to make sure this doesn't happenwhile on metformin your doctor will regularly check your kidney function tomake sure you aren't at risk for acid buildup also this acid buildup couldhappen if you take a medicine that interacts with metformin common ones arealcohol booze yeah IV contrast before like a cat scan or something certainantibiotics and some medicines for seizures and reflux so be aware of thisrare side effect number five lactic acidosis side effect number four lowvitamin b12 levels remember how I said that one way metformin works is bylowering the amount of sugar your intestines absorb well that's great butthe unwanted consequence of that mechanism is that metformin may alsolower the amounts of vitamin b12 your intestines absorb this means over thelong-run you could get low b12 levels which could make you tired or anemicwhich means low blood counts tingly or numb because your nerves are damaged sodefinitely not a side effect you want to rub elbows with but luckily this one iseasy just check vitamin b12 every few years and take a supplement if it startsgetting low easy peasy that's side-effect number fourside-effect number three weight loss okay so this is good for some but stilltechnically a side effect since metformin decreases the amount of sugarmade in the liver and also affects how your gut absorbs thingscan call a slight weight loss long-term additionally it may even work in yourbrain to slightly decrease your appetite how much weight might you lose thestudies are fairly consistent that long-term metformin used can cause abouta 5 to 10 pound weight loss side-effect number two upset stomach med Foreman'smain side effects have to do with belly problems since it works by tweaking yourliver we're just talking to you're good and also altering your intestines andhow they absorb things it makes sense that this may cause some side effectsit's thought that meant Foreman's effect on the liver and the intestines causedalterations in the bacteria that are in your gut along with increased vital inyour stool this along with a few other tweaks metformin causes and gutchemicals can make you prone to bloating nausea vomiting and all of this ties into the number one side effect of metformin diarrhea yes diarrhea withmetformin --zz effect on the gut the main complaint is loose stools ordiarrhea an oversimplified way of looking at it is metformin stops yourbelly from absorbing things now that stuff has to go somewhere instead ofbeing absorbed so out it goes through the escape hatch and loose stools ordiarrhea happen but although this is the number one side effect there's good newsgradually introducing metformin to the body can greatly reduce or eliminatethis side effect so the trick is when you start metformin you start with a lowdose around 500 milligrams and gradually make your way up to 2,000 milligramsdivided throughout the day but over the course of a few weeks you make it up tothat dose if you still have problems often switching to a capsule instead ofa tablet or an extended-release version of metformin can decrease the diarrheajust work with your doctor talk to them I promise that a solution well there youhave it the top 5 side-effects of metformin too much acid too little b12weight loss upset stomach and diarrhea but I don't want to end on a negativenote so don't it's time to speed up I made the myth one is

to my wife if one of our kidsgets type 1 diabetes I'd probably end up liking that one more Hi everybody I'mDr. Jeremy Pettus and I'm here to tell you what it's like to both be a patientliving with type 1 diabetes and somebody who's also a physician treating peoplewith type 1 okay which type of diabetes do you have and why well I have type 1diabetes which is classically kind of like the juvenile form so I got it whenI was 15 so why I don't know you know we don't know why people get it I guess Iwas the lucky one in the family okay what's it like to be a 15 year old withdiabetes in the 90s first of all there's no good time to get diabetes you know I would say people get it when they're 1, when they're 4, they're 15, when they're 55 and every age has its issues I'm guessing but as a high schooler, kind of the classic I just didn't want to be different andyou know having to test my blood sugar at school and you know back then it wasthis big glob of blood and would take a minute for it to give you your answernow it's now I don't even do it anymore but it's five seconds or less if you doso that minute is like kind of testing my blood sugar underneath my desk in themiddle of school I didn't like and getting low a lot and having to getsodas I'm having to excuse myself from sports and things like that I remembergoing to a restaurant right after I was diagnosed and ordered actually pancakesand the waiter brought syrup by and my dad yelled across the the wholerestaurant you know like we can't have regular syrup my son has diabetes andI'm like oh God so they had to get this special like you know low sugar syrupfor me so I was just kind of like dealing with embarrassment already is anawkward fifteen-year-old and then having this extra thing lumped on me justwasn't that fun but like I said I tried to just kind of take it and run with itand use some of these things to my advantage which I also tell people to dowhenever you can use type 1 diabetes to your advantage it used to be that youcould get in the front of the line at Disneyland if you had diabetes butthey got rid of that policy but you can get in free two national parks forexample so there's some good things too to get out of it and you should takeadvantage of it what's the first they people say when they find out that youhave diabetes I think people do have a lot of questions and I don't mind whenpeople ask me anything if they say hey you know like Idon't really know how much about diabetes to be honest tell me what it'slike to acts or whatever educate me I'm fine with that what bothers me is whenpeople tell me things you know they'll just come up to me at a party they don'teven know I'm a physician and say oh type 1 diabetes you can't eat candyright or did you know that there's a cure out there and they're just nottelling you about it that stuff drives me crazy so ask me all the questions youwant just don't tell me anything because chances are I know more now because I'ma doctor just because I've been living with it for so long Do you worry about your boys getting type 1 diabetes so I have a four year old and a one year old boy and yes I worry about it this is where I can rely on my education and training as a doctor in realizing that there's only about a 5 percent chance that your kids if you have type 1 will get it so if I have type 1 there's a 5 percent chance that they'll get it meaning there's a 95 percent chance that they won't get it but I think the hardest thing about it is it's just something  that I don't want to feel like I've given to my son, because the would be devastating and I'm going to move on from that one How has having diabetes affected your parenting I've joked to my wife that if one of our kids gets type 1 diabetes I'd probably end up liking that one more just because it's away of like bonding with them and you have something so serious in common whatI will say about my diabetes in my home life is I try to do it all myselfand I maybe that's like the father you know masculine provider thing that youdon't want to burden anybody else I just I don't want anybody know what my bloodsugar is I don't want suggestions on how to kind of fix things I just want totake care of it and not have it affect myself but not really have anybody elseeven be aware of it and so if my wife and kids go through the day and theyhave no idea that anything I did was diabetes related than that's a total win for me so why do you work for UC San Diego Health I thinkthere's just a lot going on here so you know I do research I do clinical careI'm somebody living with type 1 diabetes our clinical staff are excellent youknow in the clinic that I work with there's multiple other people that havetype 1 diabetes not that that makes you awesome but it definitely helpedthe research I do is clinical research so I'm seeing people and doing newtherapies and things like that so it really is this hybrid between clinic andthe research that I think is really fantastic is a cure for diabetes on thehorizon so basically everyone's always been told 10 to 15 years I have friendsthat were diagnosed in the 70s and I said 10 to 15 years 80s 10 to 15 yearsobviously we haven't had it in 10 to 15 years I don't want to put a date on itfor that reason I will say that I don't know when the Cure is going to be but inthe next 3 years something very tangible and close we will have completelyautomated insulin delivery systems that will deliver insulin based on yourcontinuous glucose monitor without you having to do much of anything countingcarbs you know thinking less about exercise things like that so it's not acure still palm continuous glucose monitor all this stuff you have to wearbut it's just gonna get a lot easier but you know less for us to think about andbetter control do you wish you could take a vacation away from your diabetesabsolutely I mean this is something about diabetes in general and type 1 isit's it's every minute of every day literally I can look right now and seemy blood sugar is if it's high or low I probably have to do something I havethought about though what if there was a cure how weird would it be to not havetype 1 diabetes because it is such a big part of me and you're gonna be strangeto all sudden just kind of walk away from it don't get me wrong I would loveit I'm trying to find this cure for me and everybody else out there so yes Iwant a vacation but yes but it's also part of me alright ok anything I wouldlike to add I would just say that again you know if I when I was 15 I rememberfeeling really bummed out that I was diagnosed with this and I I didn'tunderstand really then that this would really be something that I'd be livingwith potentially for the rest of my life but now sitting here where I am now youknow I I think that 15 year old would be really proud	High Medical Info

Rapinoe is now going to operate on Peter not because he's Abby's but to treat his diabetes by changing the anatomy of his gut Rubino believes that a section of the small intestine doesn't work properly in people with diabetes Peter stomach will be divided and re-routed so that food no longer passes through the 40 section something happens in dinner leaning which contributes to be a mechanism of diabetes and by bypassing that segment we're bypassing what could be the source of the problem [Music] when food moves through the small intestine a complex hormone signaling system tells the brain to stop eating and stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin a Fault in this signalling system would make it extremely difficult for the patient to control their eating and could explain why the body can't regulate insulin properly Peter sends a very good chance of having a complete remission of diabetes and this is an effect that was not even conceived as possible just until a few years ago the effect is so striking that in 2016 international medical guidelines were changed to include surgery as a main treatment option for some diabetes patients but very few have come forward despite the evidence suggesting that these interventions are so affected in many cases they are life-saving there are probably 0.1 to 1% of individual who meet the criteria for surgery who actually access to it type 2 diabetes is widely viewed as a lifestyle disease that patients can control on their own without the need for surgery but Rubino believes this is a misconception having an operation is not an experience that everybody would be prepared to have however the evidence we have so far has shown time and again that once you have become diabetic hope once you have very severe obesity changing your lifestyle alone is not going to bring the benefits that are needed in clinical trials Rubino is testing other ways to prevent food interacting with the faulty section of the intestine such as plastic tubing or eradicating cells from the gut wall the hope is that in the future patients like Peter won't need to have invasive surgery 7 weeks after the operation and Peter's health has taken a dramatic turn I just feel good I can just do what I want I've got a life again I can't thank professor ravine on his team enough for what they did for me I haven't took any insulin since for now at least Peters diabetes is in remission surgery alone can't halt the epidemic diabetes rates are rising in almost every country but only a few have the resources for surgery prevention through better diet and lifestyle is vital but if surgery can uncover the cause of diabetes perhaps a cure will follow [Music] you	Low Medical Info

Peripheral neuropathy is where the nervesin the feet generally don't work as well as they should for one reason or another. The most common cause of this is diabetes,however there is innumerable amounts of different causes of peripheral neuropathy. And one of the things that our task is istrying to figure out what's that cause. And if so, how can we treat that cause? Most common symptoms of peripheral neuropathyinclude cold sensations, numbness, tingling in the feet, pins and needles, burning painin the feet as well as balance issues and lightheadedness upon standing. When patients come for treatment for peripheralneuropathy, other than the actual cause of the disorder itself, most commonly that'sin the form of a bothersome tingling, pins and needles or burning pain. We treat this with a multitude of differentwe call neuropathic pain agents, which are medications that dull nerve sensations andnerve pain.	High Medical Info

Lower immunity and recurring infections are common in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden showed that the immune system of people with diabetes has lower levels of the antimicrobial peptide psoriasin, which compromises the urinary bladder‚Äôs cell barrier, increasing the risk of urinary tract infection. 

Diabetes results from lack of insulin and/or decreased insulin action. Insulin is a hormone that regulates glucose (sugar) and thus energy to the cells. In type 1 diabetes, the body stops producing insulin, while in type 2 diabetes, the cells have become less sensitive to insulin, which contributes to high blood glucose levels. Diabetes is a common disease that affects the health in many ways.

I'm Cathy with LevelUp RN. In this video,¬†I am going to cover some oral antidiabetic¬†¬† agents. And if you have our pharmacology second¬†edition flashcards, definitely pull those out¬†¬† so you can follow along with me. And at the end¬†of the video, I'm going to provide a little quiz¬†¬† to test your knowledge of some of the key points¬†that I'll be covering in this video. So definitely¬†¬† stay tuned for that. Also, it is very likely¬†there will be a blooper reel at the end of¬†¬† this video because I will be pronouncing some¬†of the oral antidiabetic medication class names,¬†¬† which are exceptionally challenging for me.¬†So thank you for your patience. And if you are¬†¬† in need of a good laugh, then definitely stay¬†tuned for those bloopers at the end of the video.¬†¬† Okay, a couple of other things I want to¬†mention before I get into specific classes¬†¬† is that oral antidiabetic agents are just for type¬†2 diabetes. So if a patient has type 1 diabetes,¬†¬† they are insulin-dependent, so they will just¬†get insulin. For patients with type 2 diabetes,¬†¬† they can be given insulin or oral antidiabetic¬†agents. So that's definitely important to know.¬†¬† The other thing I wanted to mention is that with a¬†lot of these oral antidiabetic agents, a key side¬†¬† effect of these medications will be hypoglycemia.¬†So just like with blood pressure medications,¬†¬† if the dose is too high, that blood pressure can¬†come down too low. We can end up with hypotension.¬†¬† With these oral antidiabetic medications, their¬†job is to bring blood sugar levels down. If they¬†¬† do their job too well, or we give the patient too¬†high of a dose, we can end up with hypoglycemia,¬†¬† which definitely makes sense.All right, so the first drug class¬†¬† I want to talk about here are sulfonylureas.¬†And medications that fall within this class¬†¬† include glipizide and glyburide. These medications¬†help to bring a patient's blood sugar levels down¬†¬† by increasing the release of insulin from the¬†pancreas. A contraindication of this drug class¬†¬† would be a sulfa allergy. And side effects of this¬†drug class include hypoglycemia, like we talked¬†¬† about. So signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia¬†include tachycardia, diaphoresis, shakiness,¬†¬† headache, and weakness. Other side effects can¬†include photosensitivity and GI upset. In terms¬†¬† of patient teaching, we want to advise our patient¬†to take this medication 30 minutes before a meal.¬†¬† They should not use alcohol. And they definitely¬†need to wear sunscreen when they go outside¬†¬† because of that side effect of photosensitivity.¬†So our cool chicken hint for this card, which you¬†¬† can find here at the top of the card, is when you¬†look at the drug names glipizide and glyburide,¬†¬† it makes me think of riding or sliding down a¬†slide. So that helps me to remember that you're¬†¬† going down the slide, and blood sugar levels are¬†coming down with you. Also, slides are often in¬†¬† playgrounds outside. So when I think about being¬†outside, I think about the sun being above me,¬†¬† and that helps me to remember photosensitivity as¬†a side effect of this medication cause as well.¬† Next up, we have our meglitinides. And a key¬†medication that falls within this class is¬†¬† repaglinide. This medication class has essentially¬†the same mode of action as the sulfonylureas.¬†¬† So they help to increase insulin release from the¬†pancreas. Side effects include hypoglycemia again,¬†¬† as well as angina. And then in terms of patient¬†teaching, you want to advise your patient to¬†¬† take this medication three times a day, and eat¬†within 30 minutes of taking the medication. So the¬†¬† way I remember this medication, if you look at the¬†drug name repaglinide, that pag, P-A-G, reminds me¬†¬† of a pageant. So I think of a woman who is about¬†to compete in a pageant, and she's about to go¬†¬† out on stage, but she has like chest pain,¬†and she's feeling dizzy. She has diaphoresis¬†¬† and is weak. And she's attributing all of these¬†signs and symptoms to being nervous about going¬†¬† on stage for this pageant. But in reality,¬†she just started taking repaglinide, and¬†¬† it's actually her medication that is causing that¬†angina, as well as the symptoms of hypoglycemia.¬† All right. Next, we have our biguanides, which¬†includes a medication metformin. This medication¬†¬† class works by decreasing glucose production in¬†the liver, and increasing the uptake of glucose by¬†¬† the body cells. Side effects can include GI upset,¬†a metallic taste, as well as lactic acidosis.¬†¬† And the signs and symptoms of lactic acidosis¬†include diarrhea, dizziness, hypotension,¬†¬† weakness, and bradycardia. In terms of patient¬†teaching that you need to provide for a patient¬†¬† who takes metformin, they should take this¬†medication with a meal. They should not use¬†¬† alcohol. And if they are scheduled for a procedure¬†that will require them to be NPO or a procedure¬†¬† that requires contrast dye, we need to discontinue¬†metformin 48 hours prior to that procedure.¬†¬† So my little cool chicken hint for remembering¬†some of the key side effects of metformin, is¬†¬† if you look at the word metformin, you got formin¬†as part of that. So I imagine a foreman going to¬†¬† a construction site with his metal thermos. And¬†as he's drinking from his thermos, he has like a¬†¬† metallic taste. He's like, oh, this doesn't taste¬†good. And suddenly he feels really bad too. He has¬†¬† diarrhea. He feels weak. He feels dizzy. And he's¬†chalking it up to this new thermos that he bought,¬†¬† when in actuality it is his metformin medication¬†that he just started taking for type 2 diabetes¬†¬† that is causing that metallic taste, and¬†causing those signs and symptoms of lactic¬†¬† acidosis, which include GI upset,¬†diarrhea, weakness, and dizziness.¬† Okay. Time for quiz. I have three¬†questions for you. First question,¬†¬† oral antidiabetics can be used with both¬†type 1 and type 2 diabetes, true or false?¬†¬† The answer is false. So oral antidiabetic¬†agents should only be used with patients¬†¬† with type 2 diabetes. Patients with¬†type 1 diabetes will require insulin.¬†¬† Second question, what is a key side¬†effect of many oral antidiabetic agents?¬†¬† If you said hypoglycemia, you are correct.¬†¬† Third question, what oral antidiabetic¬†agent carries a risk for lactic acidosis?¬†¬† The answer is metformin. Okay. I hope this quiz¬†has been helpful. If you would like to see more¬†¬† quizzes at the end of my videos, definitely leave¬†me a comment, and be sure to like this video as¬†¬† well. Take care and good luck studying.[BLOOPERS]¬† Next up, we have our gluta-- I'm sorry. Has¬†essentially the same mode of action as the¬†¬† sulfonylureas.

Today I‚Äôm going to share with you the best diet for peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy is a condition where you experience tingling, numbness, or burning-type pain in the bottoms of your feet or your fingertips. 

The most common cause of peripheral neuropathy is diabetes. High blood sugar can create a lot of inflammation, free radical damage, and destruction to the proteins on the inside of your arteries. This can lead to peripheral neuropathy. 

However, it can be easy to get relief from this condition. You may want to start consuming a low-carb diet (the healthy keto diet). You also may want to make sure you have very low amounts of omega-6 oils, as well as do intermittent fasting. 

Potential natural peripheral neuropathy remedies:
1. Benfotiamine (4 capsules spread out through the day)
2. Alpha-lipoic acid 
3. Tocotrienols

The Dr. Sebi Diabetes Cure is simple and takes very little money to do, but few will follow his plan. His plan was simple. Just quit eating.

 The only way you can get rid of toxins in the body is to cleanse and fast.  By not eating, you are starving the parasites and allowing the bad to excrete through your urine and feces.  As much as you would like to think you do not have parasites, sorry to inform you, but you do. here you will find a step by step guide on how to complete a 14 days detox and a 7 days gut/colon and digestive track cleanse http://bit.ly/21DaysFastDetoxAndCleanse

So if you have diabetes, you have mucus in your pancreatic duct. So part of the fasting protocol is to remove the mucus. His mother went on a fast and took her 57 days to remove her mucus. Dr. Sebi would keep her secluded for this time. I fasted 4 separate times, the most being 12 days and on my final fast, I saw the mucus. 


Dr. Sebi said ""Mucus is the cause of all disease and mucus only comes when you have digested something that should not belong in your body.""

Vincent the one person in your life that could always poison you I have no defense against her happens to be de mama so when Erin went off to st. Vincent and his mother was cooking the chicken and topless [Music] I'm just rice @p undescribed plantain era past the kitchen he swore up and down he would never submit to it but as he passed that stub with - no stop said oh my god am I gonna submit to this thing just once and you put the stuff in his mouth and he hit the bed four hours later for six months you don't cheat life after he clenched his intestines and you put that stuff in there he's gonna react violently so I tell you now you and I a part of a perspective that yes we cure AIDS that I was a Russian in russia killing aids you would say the Russian people actually aim if I was a [¬†__¬†] in China curing aids you say the Chinese people chewing aid but of your brother's telling in front of you you don't say we pureed you said he purees singling me out it's not it's not what happening kalila fruits without these we do these things so now I'm telling you tonight that we need not suffer with disease anymore Africa if we stop eating the garbage I know that when you go home you're not going to stop tomorrow because I didn't either the only reason why I jumped on the fast right quick but because you see if you have diabetes you violate or if one eye or one arm going back said you want to sex back I said what you mean to a boil is it stop eating that's it for how long 90 days and if you believe that this is a lie there is somebody in this audience and I know that to be a fact there is someone in this audience that is impotent and they're gonna try it when I'm your brother when you start eating for 30 days you won't be ready not 90 they're 40 90 you have been ready but already at 30 you must see me to tell me I just start feeling does all of this but of course of course because what you have done planned your arteries you plant your eyes clear up the nerve that good again you don't shave your understanding gets better like Cece Charles said he loved his wife of conceited because I had removed his diabetes I removed his circulation I realized the mucus only comes when you have injected something that is not and if you want a beautiful test try this one just drink one juices and occasion improve or so just do the anything any 21 days you will feel very good very strong in life and then you go back I'm a glass and you can see I know nose is gonna get tightened but many of you Sidney and those I will sit far away from here and hey that little baby with me Brazil his chest the debate that she's holding the leaders of the babies chance to see how the other babies and the babies already have uterus than his chance of course nobody imagined that baby hoarded that mucus in his chest without someone reaching out baby eating away the lining of his chest his bronchial tubes his promise and then wanted a baby kind of favor that if they beget more than the baby passes because someone did not my mother came all wrapped up you know with all the stuff that could hurt someone that is in her 70s I said my home you can't eat you can't eat no you can't you can't eat what are you talking about I raised you by the same stuff that I'm eating I said that was wrong with me when I was third yesterday I was very sick because of you but you didn't know you had the wrong information and you gave it to me thinking it was consistent you can't eat mother so what I did I would live in Puerto Rico I had a gate a very large gate to get out in the street my wife would go to work and I would lock that gate with my mama inside one day past one we passed two which passed Provost past four which passed yes four weeks a month on on the 52nd day of my mother not eating anything but drinking water on those herbs my mother goes to the bathroom and she sit there and she is passing something that's long because she felt nothing coming out of her where she wiped herself and she got up off the coat object of the commode and she looked she didn't see anything she says something had got to be in his commode she took a stick and she'd dig down in the commode and there with that long piece of mucus all the biscuits on the hog laws or the chitlins and all that of the breaking down herself ha ha our mucous membrane is now coming out my mother then realized that when that long piece of mucus came out of her like a snake she remembered she could raise a hand up Wow when she walked from the bathroom to her room she could walk better a little bit straighter it was wrapped around her colon on many of you who's sitting in this audience have it wrapped around your colon right now because no one has ever covered a comprehensive therapy that would address that to remove that so say be working at the steam engineer at Martin Luther King Hospital was able to put together without there should be because I started off eating garbage I was eating everything that my mother gave me which was guards none of it was complimenting me but what this shows that at the age of 30 I visited a Mexican Inferno hakama Ramos Mexico this man showed me that I was in direct violation of My Ancestors he took you away from all brothers thoughts and he gave you these Treat Bags these bad would last me a month a bunch of are already grind up a mix but I never knew what the verbs were because that's a straight long no I made three cups of tea every day I would drink three cups of tea every day at the ending of 90 days I didn't have any disease but as eme yes I'm going through the bathroom Thailand ten times a day I had a great big stomach I was passing fecal matter for days even after the knee 48 days after they need of it they're passing people back then it was just mucus coming up but when I noticed was this from the body from the value my bowels why what I remember I are not that I'm not having at the book that when the first 714 days the first seven days I was busy from the seventh to the 50-day know from the first day to the seventh day I was calm and pretty after good but on the seventh or fifteen of a dizzy every day I would disi at the quarter bathroom on my all fours I went to the bathroom for whole week on my knees at my hands I couldn't stand out because everything was moving but on the sixteenth day when I woke up it was a piece that I remember a piece that I had never met you in my life there are the 27 on the upper the 28-day attend here tweezing in my chest alleged to have been a smooth then my diabetes 440 and 200 no longer exist 291 27 on the 57 day I woke up and this way an argument come into my brain when I was a little boy all the men in Honduran Trinidad from Barbados from the United States they would have this conversation in the barbershop and what they would always say that if you want to please your wife sexually eat a lot of aids raw and drink a lot of milk and eat a lot of raw meat or meat for protein come well these things are the very things that interfere with your life now I didn't eat anything for 57 days and when I woke up after not having an erection for two years I was in portent why am I not impotent when I woke up at the fifty-seven day why my penis is erect because my body got the opportunity to drain itself of the buildup of calcification cholesterol triglycerides on the rest so now the artifice which is the penis is spongy it need blood to flow to Durant it but now those little orifices are clogged but in 57

everybody Susie Baker what's up Susie Baker with the first comment you were here early HSN family says lovely m74 what's up Michael why isn't our what's up man John Titor the time traveler Michelle M what's up John C from the Bay Area as of air-quality up there man crazy insanity over there right now both my both of my in-laws are at places in Santa Rosa the opposite side of town that's not burning but yeah that's just insane and all those fires overnight in California too how many fires was a there was a Potter Valley one which we've got friends up in that area - over in the Golden Triangle well legal and illegal farms burning down all over California is just crazy crazy crazy crazy I think it's right before their harvest - and one's getting ready to harvest burned so hope everyone's well up there and uh and Northern California hope everybody's uh safe you know maybe get like a HEPA filter going on there and uh yeah keep those lungs healthy I got sensitive little lungs I used them wrong for years barely use them for years I was an asthmatic child with asthma and allergies so I know what it's like to have trouble breathing and air quality can definitely affect it stress and trauma definitely affect those things more kick ass Quito what's up Charlie see Gina Jones Tina Panos in Kingston Ontario what's up Gina Jones as what was that music that's a demo that's a demo from Bob Marley called slogans and I don't think he did I don't think he ever recorded like a album version of the song I don't think it's on any of the albums so hey maybe I won't get flagged with a copyright violation for playing that YouTube making that money for the record companies Tina says she likes the tunes right on a vault a speeder what's up man s la Moammar kick ass Quito in Philly s lungs asking thoughts on milk a lot of articles circling around that it's bad and we don't need it lol well you don't need milk you don't need any certain food right I mean you need water you need protein a certain lipids you need amino acids you need milks not essential cow's milks not good for everybody and there's many people who believe if it's not good for any I know that there's a big difference in how my body reacts to pasteurized crap mass produced hormone injected milk I mean it's like what are we looking at we looking at Oh milk are we looking at like grass-fed raw milk right I mean I can go get raw milk from any of the neighbors drink it and feel fine but I do know that when I cut out dairy like commercial milk products pasteurized they're 10 almost but I think 9 years ago in 2009 8 years ago some like that whatever who's counting I obviously can't count but when I cut out dairy felt way better you know my lungs got a little bit more clear I felt less inflamed but that was commercial dairy that I grew up on you know it was mass-produced junk food and they're all fed GMO corn and soy which you know it's not a whole GMOs or bad GMOs what these GMO crops are engineered so you could spray heavy amounts of pesticides on them so whether or not the GMO aspect of it is bad it's it's undeniable that these pesticides are incredibly bad for the human body brain and gut microbiome which intimately links to the brain the vagus nerve gut brain connection inflammation in the gut causing inflammation in the brain causing systemic inflammation so yeah I mean commercial dairy corn fed Monsanto corn so supporting the consolidation of the food supply in the hands of Bayer Monsanto remember Bayer and Monsanto have now merged in a 66 of course billion dollar deal 66 bees these X billion dollars remember the history of Bayer as well formerly IG Farben became Bayer after the Nuremberg trials once you go ahead and look in the history of IG Farben Bayer pharmaceutical yeah I've been sending live HIV and AIDS virus out throughout Europe infecting and killing thousands of people whoops whoops sorry says bear yeah I mean holiday not only is this commercial dairy production the Vienna ciao gracias you'll see that throughout the red Jessica kana sylveon it's a luego these commercial dairies not only treat the animals like crap keep them caged up are injecting them with hormones that will make them produce more they also give them antibiotics to make them fatter and to keep them infection free because they live in a disgusting area where they can't have free movement they don't have good lymph flow because they're blocked up all the time I mean it's it's terrible it's like you kind of you understand where a lot of the vegans are coming from when it's like that you grow up in the suburbs and you start to see these images and that's what is that's what most of our food supply is produced as you know just cows and boxes getting shot up with antibiotics so it's like not just the human animal suffering aspect of it but um you know these antibiotics have negative effects on the body as well destroy the gut microbiome and they'll accumulate in the tissues of these animals and glyphosate accumulates in the tissues of these animals as well and it's passed through breast milk Monsanto and they're fake studies that they put on the 70s when they got it you know bullhorn through you know when your government your government which is Monsanto which is pharmaceutical companies which is the media military-industrial complex there's no like the government you know it's all outsourced corporate outsourcing in the 70s when they pushed glyphosate through they said oh it doesn't go through the milk it doesn't bioaccumulate in animals but now we know that all of this is untrue with lies I mean leveraging science with a line through the S fake science to to push products like this on the human on the human population in my opinion is pretty lame pretty lame so anyways yeah commercial dairy we're looking at hormones antibiotics destruction of gut microbiome from heavy glyphosate accumulation in that dairy but I mean if you've got like good grass-fed raw dairy might treat you differently right and dairy in and of itself milk and of itself I don't think is bad you know I mean it's like if you have a sensitivity to it sure but if you come from certain lineages I mean people from British Isles and certain parts of Northern Europe can handle type a one dairy other populations handle type A two dairy much better that's the type of casein that's actually in it there's a one and A two A two much less gnarly effect on individuals who are sensitive to Dairy so it's not such a you know black and white yes or no answer unfortunately like anything in reality it's not just like you know yes that's good or that's bad dairies bad carbs are bad fat is bad saturated fat is bad you know it's like it's all about context so thoughts on milk I just gave you a lot we've got raw milk in our fridge give it to our daughter all the time goat's milk to you know high quality cheese's grass-fed cows fantastic nothing wrong with it in context if you don't have a sensitivity to it so thanks snoo world what's up Michelle em nailed it she got the song right slogans wolf spider what's up man Jennie Angie says I don't know what I'm going to do when I go work I'm going to miss all your lives gonna miss all my lives but all your lives I read that wrong you're gonna miss all our lives may be fine you could listen to it later you'll watch it later but also it's a lot of the same stuff over and over again but maybe you just like me you think I'm entertaining for some reason this is the second time I've used SoundHound on your Marley and it has picked up nothing what's that track mate yeah it picked up nothing because a lot of the times when I'm playing music I will intentionally use bootleg tracks demo tracks and tracks that are not copyrighted other times I just play whatever cuz youtube D monetizes everything now if you have I mean there's the crawlers if you've got any copyrighted music the monetization it's like I wouldn't care but it's like you put on music and then it's like Island Records is making the money that you're monetizing and I say so as a YouTube it's awesome it's cool but now that the monetization is a part of it basically like television you know I think you can't use copyrighted music so I guess yeah you gotta give the artists their do but it's like the artists are making money anyways I mean they've just signed on the dotted line gonna be a star kid Charlie C what's up Brian Street Chesapeake Virginia radio Faneca my voice might sound a little weird today I have a sore throat but it actually feels much much better I gotta change the weather here Ariana and Ryder both had stuffy noses sore throats everyone's got a sore throat in a coffin town thought I was gonna be immune to it I had a little sore throat today and I didn't feel like doing any video editing or you know Ashley doing anything that would require a great amount of focus planning and whatnot but I wanted to get some work done so I did a surprise live hangout do it's a gasps tomb what's that they went radio phonic ado it says so happy for your new book coming out yeah it's gonna be rad for those of you who didn't watch the last live hangout we did a surprise even to us announcement that and it's basically just to tell ourselves we've got to do this this week we're putting out the ultimate guide to low carb baking this week so you guys have probably seen a lot of the crazy pictures of stuff that Jessica's been making over the last year she started doing the lowly the ultimate guide to low carb baking which is a keto friendly baking sour recipes so we've got it's it's very comprehensive the ultimate guide to low carb baking it's not just a cute title it's legit she spent the last year just making all kinds of delicious things different textures and flavors and experimenting with everything as far as low carb baking goes and she's ready to share it you ready to share with you guys so we've had the ketogenic edge cookbook the training manual for low carbohydrate genican paleo cuisine has been out for over a year now almost a year now and who it took us a year and a half to get that book this one was about a year in the production but uh yeah the new the ultimate guide to low carb baking this is more for more advanced techniques right the ketogenic etch cookbook the training manual is essentially there to help you build a foundation of food prep nutrient-dense Whole Foods it's focused all on that so there's no like you know keto coffee cake recipe in that book and we've got the broccoli muffins might be in there actually I'm minding I don't think the broccoli muffins are in there those are on our website but uh you know the keto flatbread stuff like that the basic essentials how to prepare awful organ meats liver pate Mama's best meatballs those types of recipes those are the basics the foundations of keto food prep because I mean let's be honest most of us who are trying to get healthy trying to change our body trying to change our minds or hearts we don't really know how to nourish and feed ourselves we didn't we weren't raised with those habits right you know I mean I I knew how to pour cereal and cut a bagel in half put butter on it with a little bit of salt and slathered in Korean cheese after I put it in a broiler that was about the extent of my food prep that I knew I knew how to go buy burritos at Lola's I knew how to go get pizza knockout in Carlsbad where he used to work in high school I'll get free pizza for my buddies beater you had to do all that knew how to eat Ben and Jerry's I didn't know how to real wholesome nutritious food and well-balanced meals that have give me the proteins fats fiber and vegetables I needed and that was something that came later in life when I was like 21 23 22 when I started actually making my own food and getting serious about treating my body right because I knew if I can't go on that route my body was just gonna be completely destroyed if I kept going around I was going that major injuries chronic inflammation gnarly injury to the hip that twisted me up a little bit more than I my body Hardy was and uh yeah after that I wanted to get healthy I wanted to feel my body again I wanted to be able to walk and stand up straight and learning to feed myself was a huge part of that journey so yeah the ketogenic etch cookbook is available now the ketogenic entrecote book is a training manual for low carb ketogenic and paleo cuisine that's on the website only on our website primal edge health and that's available now but the ultimate guide to low carb baking is coming on Friday that's right it's gonna be released on Friday and we might do a special presale if we can get this landing page right we might do a special presale for live viewers and people who subscribe to our newsletter so that might announce that and own another hangout this week we're in another video but that books coming out Friday it's freaking epic you guys have seen like some of the crazy recipes the keto coffee cake the the perfect coconut flour pancakes three she's got three different versions of Pancakes so it's essentially it's kind of like the ketogenic edge cookbook where she's trying to transmit her knowledge to you and show you how to manipulate ingredients that get different flavors textures mouthfeel stuff like that and yeah it was really fun being around her while she made this book over the last year you know she did it when she was pregnant with rider who was born one year ago we started making these recipes when she was pregnant so I guess it's a little over a year that she's been working on it I could be wrong maybe she started right after he was born but for the last year she's had a steady flow of Awesome Locard keto baked stuff and I'm not it's not just like sweet things to half of the book is savory right so we've got like the all-purpose keto bread the broccoli muffin recipe might even pee in there too or moderate some modifications of it loads of savory stuff and you can actually we made a French toast with this all-purpose keto bread uh and as ridiculous and then there's an entire section of more desert type stuff as well so I think she's got over a hundred recipes the books like well over 200 pages long it's its new tree it's a nutrient-dense book so yeah we'll talk more about it maybe we'll do a preview of it but that's all I gotta say about that right now DeWitt thanks for bringing it up I'm happy the books coming out as well this book might have a little bit I don't know I don't I don't know if it's gonna have a narrower audience because I'm always recommending the ketogenic edge cookbook especially for beginners and for people who are starting a healthy diet right you don't want to like jump right into trying to make all I'm doing keto first meal I makes gonna be a keto blueberry pie it's like chill out on that stuff for a while let your body adapt let your pal adapt build on the basics so use the first book when you're starting then when you're gonna have family gatherings cooking for kids right which can be really hard sometimes when they're so picky kids are alone this is picky as I am with their food but yeah you know family gatherings dates got friends coming over whatever holidays sports games whatever when you're going to an event or a potluck or something like that maintaining a low carb diet can sometimes be hard for people mentally but this book's really cool because it actually gives you so many options where you can make these delicious low carb foods that most people wouldn't even have to realize they're like keto friendly foods they're like super low-carb keto foods if you don't have to no it's still super delicious for everybody you know it's like we tested these on our daughter that's how we know if something is good our daughter tells us could I ask some more we know it's good all right radio phonic a-- what's up radio fernika tucks gazon what's up Elizabeth in Santa Barbara Elizabeth glam is own in the UK all right oh the thing just skip down way far skip just down all right let's go back up Kukulcan what's up man all right here we go crab ride street says primal flagged for greatness primal primal such a cool word but like now I see it in a lot of other places like no marketing can really ruin terms right it's like the song is plainer don't can't take your slogans no more you hear something over and over again you see what it's associated with sometimes it makes you annoy branding stuff is hard right but I really like primal edge health as the name I like the word edge right because we're always push up towards that edge right we always want to push up towards the unknown towards the the mystery Ryan and primal it's like a primacy of life the the primal nature of reality the primal essence of being in the moment that's why I like those words and then after we branded it and we started putting out content I realized a lot of other people were using primal as well but whatever it's all good all right Kukulcan says cow's milk is for cows cow's milk is for cows humans milk is for humans and humans are intelligent enough it's a harvest cow's milk just like honey is for bees cow's milk is for cows that's kind of a funny epistemological stance and kind of just a linguistic game cow's milk is for cows bees honey is for bees goats meat is for lions and me I had loads of goat meat the last two days we got goats meat from our friend Adrian shoutout to Adrian who probably never watches this stuff Adrian lives a mountain over and she's got goats she gets a good goat milk she makes goats cheese but every once in a while she slaughters a good goat she slaughtered a goat we got a leg we got some ribs and it was just so good and I almost want to end this live hangout right now and eat my second meal of the day for breakfast I had duck eggs but you're super super good too I'm a huge fan of duck eggs what weird food writing decades ago fists yeah it sounds weird but man is goat meat good if you prepare it right it could be really tough if it's done wrong we slow-cooked it and we actually put in that we baked it for a little while before slow cooking in a little so good some spices in there but not too many spices made some really good broth with it too super jelly goat broth but yeah I had I had duck eggs which are so good like huge yolks on duck eggs and I'll boom it on the duck eggs the the white of the duck eggs it's really thick they're like twice as big as a normal chicken egg there's a small chicken egg and oh man oh so good and I actually this might sound kind of weird but I had it with and I don't put it on it but I supplemented a few bites just straight from the bag of chlorella so I had like a bite of the the duck egg with the goats meat and there's grass-fed butter loads of salt on there and I actually used a little bit of this red palm oil that we get from a guy in Peru I'm not a big fan of like commercial red palm oil production I usually tell people tell pie red palm oil because it's very environmentally destructive in the way that most people are growing it clear-cutting rainforest and it's pretty unsustainable crop but the stuff we got from a real small farm this stuff is really good and so I also had some red palm oil on those eggs loads of salt and the go me and I chewed it up and I took a little bit of chlorella and I added it to the bite and it just smoothes that bite out it has you know chlorella has got all these green pigments the chlorophyll loads of chlorophyll just full of micronutrients and it's almost pure protein but also binds like heavy metals bromides and mercury and toxins whoa my family's home Hey Ryder's asleep just goes out of breath carrying a thousand pound baby on her back and Ariana's nowhere to be seen just at her wits end with Arianna apparently this is like reality TV for you guys you guys want to see Jessica and Ariana going at it I want to see a five-year-old breaking a 29 year old woman down 29 30 I almost got Jessica to believe that she was 30 years old like a few days ago she was like saying it like it was true is I'm 30 right year older than her like a year and a half she's to be 29 on November 1st I almost had her convinced that she was turning 30 just like just subtle and LP just dropping it in there once in a while all right Charlie C was the ideal food to break and extend it fast bone broth mmm no not bone I don't know maybe some broth yeah sure what's the ideal food what's the ideal food for me to break up 224 a 64 hour faster what's the best food for you I don't know I'd probably do like well I'm just I was just talking about my meal that I ate this morning and yesterday three times which was eggs with goats me some good fats and some chlorella and spirulina added selectively at select points during the chew of the bite like this is a highly scientific process guys when you put the chlorella in your mouth is of the utmost importance you already have to have the meat and the salt needs to be almost gone from the bite you know when you chew it for a while you chew your food well which everybody should be true in their food well right regardless of what foods you eat and I'm obviously talking about some funny foods read the deck eggs with the goats meat also so good you could do the same things with normal eggs and some like slow-cooked pot roast or something like that too but this was just extra special the time that you add stuff to your bite is of crucial importance if you add a little bit of chlorella or spirulina at a certain point of the bite during the chew really good but also let's talk about some like practical advice and let's just stop and you know me talking to myself making myself hungry all right sound so sad she's all sniffily what's wrong are you okay your nose is super stuffy oh man keep telling you to go vegan you want to be a vegan re okay I'll stop I'm sorry okay chewing food is the utmost importance obese people chew their food ten times or less per bite lean people between in a hundred times this is what I tell a lot of clients you have some cheese in your nose you can pick eat the cheese I got for the market I don't know it's some kind of a goat cheese it's an orange aged goat cheese yeah but it's not open yet yeah she's a cheese hound she'll eat anything if you put a bunch of cheese on it okay okay so yeah chewing chew your food liquefy your food in your mouth so many enzymatic processes start in the mouth and hormonal processes are triggered by what's going on in the mouth if you chew your food for two to three times as long as you've been chewing it already I bet you'll have better digestion better assimilation of nutrients and you'll feel better in general chewing your food sounds so basic so simple but a lot of people forget we're in a hurry rats swallow swallow or so like now if you turn use your mouth like a blender liquefy turn it to liquify liquify that food esalaam says I guess I'll just get a cow for my coffee milk or just use some cream man use some heavy cream all right Brian Street says you don't need a ton of food input to add lean protein woody tongue do you think bulking on Kido is something that works well I feel better when I'm on keto but I want to put some size on good question Canada SRS and Brian Street started answering the question you can dad and we put muscle mass on on Kido if you get sufficient protein and you eat sufficient fats keep the carbs low you can maintain your keto State and still build lean muscle mass what's required for lean muscle mass building is first of all you to trick your body into believing it needs it so you need to do damage to your muscle tissue so your body has to rebuild fix that camera then the next thing that's really important is you need enough calories and it's known that out it's known now that you can actually build muscle in a caloric deficit as well as long as you get enough protein so sufficient protein 0.8 grams per pound of your lean body mass is what I recommend for protein intake for muscle building and for most people starting keto in general because it's an easy number to throw out there that'll work for 99.99999 set if set percent of people not too little not too much so get sufficient protein 0.8 grams per pound of your lean body mass what I'd actually do if you're bulking point 8 grams per pound of your desired lean body mass so you're trying to add 10 more pounds of muscle mass over the next I don't know I mean depending on where you're at like if you're a beginner right which I'm gonna assume that you're just starting you're looking to Lima as lean muscle mass you can add like 15-20 pounds in the first year most people if you're dieting right for hormones are okay and if you're healthy so what you want to do is maybe add about I don't know 10 grams 15 grams it's almost really needed 10 15 grams more protein then what's your point grams per pound your lean body mass is use fat as the energy source that's the fuel source so you don't want to be trying to burn a bunch of body fat while adding a bunch of lean muscle if you're already lean but if you've got a hundred pounds of fat to lose you can build muscle all the way down so it all depends on context but get enough protein tell your body that needs the muscle through training and keep your hormones right sleep well don't be stressed out all the time and you'll add lean muscle I had a loaded lean muscle mass on a ketogenic diet actually prune back on my training quite a bit because I mentioned like injuries earlier and I had some structural imbalances that were exacerbated by adding more lean muscle mass than I was wheeled incorrectly on my frame so taking a step back rearranging my to my back and yeah and also just you know the style of training that I enjoy doing now my style of life without that right now and what I like doing with my energy and how I like spending my time um I'm just not that into lifts and heavy right now so yeah that's all I got for you you can add lean muscle mass on keto get enough protein point eight grams per pound of your desired lean body mass that's your energy source keep your carbs low you'll be alright Brian streets has 66 billion dollars that's a lot of cash that's just surface cash to haven't come on how much is really gonna be made on that I mean you've got big pharma big agriculture always been you know one hand wipe in the other but now just right before our eyes and who cares right no one cares what are the Kardashians doing what is celebrities saying about no celebrities don't talk about it who cares what's on the news what's the new distraction okay happy Monday says Renee Michelle yes happy Monday if you have a milk cow it's definitely work that fresh butter cream etc totally having a milk out awesome hmm s ylim says so milks that's a organic / GMO free is okay to drink I don't I mean it's a are you sensitive to Dairy No then dairy is probably fine is is commercial dairy okay to drink sure loads of people drinking are not unhealthy I don't like to drink it I think that it makes my body feel less optimal and more less healthy so you can do it everyone man so you want to drink milk like yeah gopher gmo-free like rb/gh free stuff or gay but correctly you are grass-fed this organic can mean that it's eating organic corn which is still unfortunately even organic foods are contaminated with glyphosate and cows are not meant to be eating grains they're not grain eating animals they eat grass the wild they herbs so um yeah you just want stuff we want an animal that eats what it's supposed to eat Renee says only wild game and grass-fed meat for my family learning so much from your channel thanks for an a that's awesome that you guys got wild game meat that's fantastic oh as Ariana once said that is fantastic good which is her word that she invented yeah she said there she is Ahri's back what are you eating she's eating cheese and cream there you go it's not just about good bad it's like a she's eating loads of cheese and cream and that's high-quality stuff though you know it's like it's fresh cream from grass-fed cows good cheese but hey it's not about Dogma Oh dairies bad this is that oh so people on paleo say dairies bats I gotta be with their crew I want to be accepted by them okay Austin says and I watched a video of yours and you had said work one's way into the MCT oil and I was all like nah I'll be fine I got a gut of Steel that was yesterday and gee how wrong I was and Austin is probably typing that from the toilet r.i.p your toilet but yeah alright so MCT oil use into it can be a laxative and it's very antifungal too so it's like if people have got imbalances and have candida overgrowth which is you know I mean I'm gonna try to freak people out about Candida hello wife how are you I was just speaking to our invisible fake friends on YouTube and imagining what they might look like as I speak to them very nice very nice they're all naked they're all attractive women oh there's Arianna what's up with them pigtails look our daughter looks like a cocker spaniel alright Anna's being ridiculous she's trying to entertain one moment all right what are we talking about what are we talking about okay yeah MCT oil ease into it laxatives will give you disaster pants if you're not careful and you take three tablespoons of it and you've never had it before Shayne's has reached nutritional ketosis following followed by an extended fast this is the morning of day 5 not hungry still jimang keto is the way I love your channel alright still jimang day 5 an extended fast why you going to the gym on extended fast you do realize that you're going to damage the muscle tissue and you won't be able to repair that without amino acids and yes I understand you're in deep atif in G you feel great you've got all kinds of awesome stress hormones running through your body making you feel high high high on that fast and that's good chill out on the gym though maybe alright be careful right because you're not going to be able to like recover from that without sufficient protein so yes you still use your muscles but what I would do are doing an extended fast like that is not do heavy resistance training or sprinting or super high intensity stuff more mellow stuff mobilization you know stretching out muscles relaxing the body but hey do what you got to do explore your new life and I'm drinking water esalaam delicious water can you have carnitine on keto yeah carnitine acetyl l-carnitine all car can be really good too carnitine can be really helpful for breaking down body fat did you make your videos in Ecuador I live in Ecuador so I'm making this video in right now kick-ass keto my friend is wondering how long she should wait after starting keto to put herself in a calorie deficit I told two weeks her metabolisms probably healing from unhealthy eating / starving I would tell your friend alright kick-ass keto just to give everyone context kick-ass Kito's friend is Thanks you're so awesome by the way I'm glad that you're helping your friend and like you're always tuned in to this and then you're like trying to get the nuggets of information and stuff and then you're passing it on this is really cool so kickass Kido you kick ass you're awesome kick ass Kido do this have your friend maybe just eat the satiety for a while and enjoy it for a few weeks like if she's in a hurry to lose the weight I mean that she's already tied in with this stress about gaining way stress about eating that eating the disordered eating in the past just just help her rebuild her habits and a healthy mind state around the food without attachment to physical change results and comfort from the figure physical change in results right so she wants to lose the weight and that's fine you want to be health you want to lose the weight but because of the history of disordered eating body dysmorphia and all this stuff it's like you got to be careful so I would say it's better for her to just enjoy the foods nourish herself focus on enjoying life and let that deficit be made naturally when she's just when her hunger really drops and she doesn't feel like eating so much then then getting into a nice deficit s Lamar says my friend vlogs and he was in a restaurant and YouTube D monetize his video for a song that was playing in the background for a few seconds yeah that's what's up d monetize it but not only is the video demonetized but if wmg or Warner Brothers music owns that Warner Brothers makes the money from YouTube so YouTube started out no monetization no censorship anything could be put on there regardless of what your opinion was it was rad anything like it was like people were putting full documentaries up there I remember first seeing John de Kamp's film about the Franklin cover-up way back in the day this like that film was their spin by Brian Springer remember that was on there I think some of these are probably still up but yeah it's like now the copyright stuff is so intense it's so monetize and corporatize that uh you know I mean it's it's about that money you look at the top videos what are they what are the the trending and top which is doesn't mean anything it says YouTube picks them they're all mainstream television now and the ads that are on the videos they're all it's like government motors General Motors you know the latest movies in a hot movie L'Oreal like it's just it's the same [¬†__¬†] you see on TV now looks like the advertisers are the same YouTube equals new TV we do need a new platform somebody hurry up and go make it I don't know I don't know I don't have time to think about what the new platform should be like right you got to keep porn and stuff off but you can't censor people for questioning mainstream narratives the [¬†__¬†] that they're fed on the news this is being censored now because the same companies are the main advertisers on YouTube Circle Circle Circle Circle jerk alright okay Casey says I had emailed you guys on your website website how long should I wait to get a reply what you email me about Casey email us again what do you need send an email Tristan app primal edge health calm Christina says I like your videos I've been looking into the me to diet over the

modify that recipe infinitely right and it's a way to get kids the vegetables and greens they're so good it was broccoli muffins are amazing yeah they're like MIT regular muffins totally though with broccoli but you there's a savory muffin a really really good mountain bear says well YouTube won't play your stream today guess I'll have to watch later that's too bad sorry about that maybe it's not advertiser friendly Google's crawlers heard me talking about Monsanto Bayer merger earlier and they don't like that the biggest advertisers in the world they're pharmaceutical big ad Kraft Kellogg alright love the live chat education your channel is completely opposite of most Chiquito channels yet I find it the most educational and the most information you put out has worked for me way better than the others thanks man so we don't just repeat the same stuff that other people for Pete actually explore this stuff for ourselves we try to stay a few steps ahead of the herd or as most people are concerned with getting attention from or being a part of the herd when you forget the herd you don't worry about the herd you focus on life you focus on living amazing things happen Christina coconut flour pancake three different versions of the coconut flour pancake choose your weapon all those are gonna be in the ultimate guide to low carb baking but they're not just like the standard

to low carb baking it's coming it's gonna be ridiculous she's asked if you use sugar-free maple syrup on keto there's a syrup recipe in the book that Jessica made using zero glycemic sweetener the one we prefer to use as far as sweeteners go and I haven't even tried their maple syrup thing I didn't look at the ingredients of it but there's a company called LeConte oh they make a product that is a river tall which is a natural fountain than the human body and it is indigestible meaning you pee it out meaning it tastes sweet it's got little granules looks like sugar but you pee it out doesn't affect blood glucose levels now they mix this with a special extract of something called monk fruit monk fruit actually lowers blood glucose and helps to stabilize blood sugar levels is very very sweet but by itself can have a funny aftertaste but when you mix it with the look like how la canto does it they make this really nice blend and we really like that so that's a sweetener that we actually use in the book for most of things that would have sweeteners which isn't even most half the book is savory so it's not just sweet stuff and so yeah we like that sweetener but of course like if you just starting ketogenic diet chill out on the sweet stuff don't need to go so crazy on sweeteners these non glycemic sweeteners can trigger hunger because the body taste it and you taste that sugar and you taste a sugary taste rather and it still makes you want to eat right so you've got to be careful with some of these low carb things can't go too nuts on the keto coffee cake which is one of my favorite recipes in that book so oh yeah yeah just measure we actually talked to the makers of conto and they're really cool a small family company the company originated in Japan LeConte oh la que a nto offered us a 20% discount that we could share with you guys so you get 20% off you go to luck on TOCOM use the coupon code primal edge health lower case all one word primal edge health and you can get the la canto which is a rift throat all with monk fruit extract and there's awesome blend can be used as a one-to-one ratio there's a sugar substitute yes you check that out Lacan TOCOM use the coupon code primal edge health all lowercase all one word you get twenty flippin percent off we actually Potts them the other day too oh yeah real cool company small family company they're all about getting people off sugar and processed junk food and yeah these can be really good tools for people transitioning to but like I said before when you're first starting out a ketogenic diet you gotta check out the first book that we made the ketogenic edge cookbook or just like the for all the free recipes we got on our website and our books and stick to the the simple keto meals at first while you're getting adopted because you want to build a solid foundation of nutrient-dense whole food food prep when you're starting a new diet you don't want to just go eat quest bars and Kido Kido doughnuts all day right it's about nutrient-dense Whole Foods and the whole guide to low carb baking we did our best to formulate all the recipes so that they are maximizing nutrient density using the best ingredients possible that are not gonna cause reactions and most people and yeah so I'm a picky eater Jessica knows that and so is my daughter and so these all these recipes are actually kid-friendly our daughter likes um I like them and they don't bug my sensitive tummy so that's what's up Janine says not a huge fan of coconut I made cream cheese cookies yesterday with coconut flour they taste nothing like cream cheese hmm you could really taste the coconut that sounds like you did use that coconut flour wrong cuz in any recipe Jessica makes like if you use the right ratio coconut flour it doesn't have to taste super coconut yes coconut flour can be dense but you can mix it with other stuff too and you're using the right ratio it shouldn't taste like that so maybe you just had a crappy recipe too sorry to hear that but yeah coconut flour can be good now I remember the first time we type try coconut flour I hated it though it was like 2009 we made this a coconut flour bread and we made it in the wrong ratio and it was just it was so dense and I didn't like it but you also may just have like the wrong brand of coconut flour maybe it's a crappy brand so I don't know maybe try a different one Ren I ordered my mom free sweetener from LeConte oh thanks for the link now I just need Jessica's low-carb baking cookbook I yeah Rene all right let's see what else is going on here Lily says the best cookbook well thank you Alastair Thompson says strangely I'm now craving broccoli well do do the broccoli muffin recipe get that it's free on our website the other website get the broccoli muffin recipe super super good Jose Calvin says broccoli and so good don't go together I would have said that too before I tried these that sweet potato frosting I don't know I'm not in the potatoes far potatoes Christina says the new platform will turn into YouTube that doesn't have to if things are made with the right intention and the right limitations they don't have to just become corporate [¬†__¬†] machines Tristan's thoughts on white blood glucose is around 105 first thing in the morning while doing keto diet I keep seeing others in the 70s 80s well are you others are you other people no all right so your blood glucose is 105 in the morning that's important in your context who cares what other people say or do 105 some people might have high fasting fasting blood glucose because they're not sleeping very well so that could be one thing you could have a disrupted circadian rhythm which will cause disrupted blood glucose throughout the day also and there's many things that could be going on here some people get everybody on keto gets what's called physiological insulin resistance now 105 is a little higher for blood glucose in one obviously like healthy blood glucose you wanted a seven in the 80s 70 is not necessary but there's people who get higher blood glucose readings in the morning on keto but have perfectly healthy hemoglobin a1c levels which gives you a snapshot of what your blood glucose is throughout the day so what you should do is get your hemoglobin a1c checked and see if it's changed evolving Aaron V what's up says you look thinner dropping weight no maybe less inflamed or some of them my bodies on the up-and-up it's always changing oh yeah I haven't been made me my face is dinner I am pretty I'm pretty ripped right now I guess pretty lean right now alright I'm as lean as I've ever been and maintained for a long period of time for the last year I've stayed really lean which is interesting especially considering my wife's been making up baked goods cookbook this year it just shows you it's like if you can control your portions if you actually give yourself a healthy diet and lifestyle you can still eat good keto baked goods and keep a nice healthy body but yeah yeah Brian Street says that's nice of you thank you Brian so Brown alleged live broadcast is a great little community that's spread across the world how crazy is that and you guys just see me I didn't see you it'd be so fitting if your last name was copper it's like your brand metal look I got copper flash side copper Cup I like copper I wanted to paint my truck like kind of a copper orangish color but I couldn't bring myself to not paint it red because it's been red its whole life and I felt like it'd be like cheating it so yeah the colors are that I would have thought would look way cooler I didn't do and I picked this blood-red color which is gonna look awesome can't wait till it things done all right let's see what else Leigh Leigh thank you for saying that it's the best cookbook I appreciate that s llem says advertise a book on Facebook no I don't like promoting Facebook I don't like I'm not gonna pay facebook to advertise my book thank you for the suggestion but I will not give Facebook money how was that Galvan says indeed it's cauliflower that should be feared don't look at it it's evil why why don't you like cauliflower what's wrong with cauliflower all right let's see what else Kristin says I'm already subscribed so I'll keep an eye out for the email and pre-order woohoo yeah we got to do a pre-order stuff for the for the close friends here the people who are always tuning in can you refill glut muscle glycogen on keto without carb cycling if so how if not and maintain muscle energy I bend over anneal and lift at work Khal Drogo you will refill muscle glycogen regardless of what mak macronutrients you eat you will refill muscle glycogen within hours of a workout if you eat nothing you don't need carbohydrates for muscle glycogen your body can break down glycerol which is the backbone of fatty acid and turn that into glycogen it can also break down certain amino acids and make glycogen as well so fear not you can refill your muscle glycogen and bending over and kneeling to lift things up at work is not getting rid of your muscle glycogen you're refilling it constantly so just I mean if you my best advice for you if you just stop listening to all these bro Fitness people they love to confuse people and market you nonsense so you need a carb cycle you need this you need more protein powder it's like come on man this is it's the same thing they've been doing this for decades marketing nonsense you don't need like dextrose powder after every time you bend over to pick up something off the ground I tied my shoe better get some dextrose so you need to refill back like Oh Jen nah man it'd be good obviously you're already jacked called Drogo Khal Drogo is on mostly meat horse heart alright lately says my stomach gets upset when I eat sugar alcohols we are what are you are you eating what's that xylitol that stuff makes everyone's stomach upset almost martu is bought monk fruit 100% and didn't like it yeah dude 100% monk fruit extract is not good that's why it like you you you need a little bit of that monk fruit and then it's mixed in with the erythritol the erythritol erythritol doesn't bug most people's guts doesn't create issues like a lot of people get with xylitol and these other sugar alcohols erythritol is real mellow oh that Marta was said erythritol is quite good though using in curry sauces yeah yeah if you need too much of and he Chicago says after 15 grams max he doesn't like how it feels in his tummy right on so yeah the Lacan so though it's a real turtle with the monk fruit extract so you kind of get the best of both both world the monk fruit Tate has an aftertaste that's not very nice in the canto they've done a really good job at getting rid of that Michelle says she puts eyelets on heavy cream in the coffee whose eyelets halt I don't like that stuff not a fan for some reason John C says I read Lacan so doesn't have much if any monk fruit yeah it only needs a little bit of the monk fruit extract a little monk fruits also zero glycemic because it's five hundred thousand times or whatever supposedly sweeter than sugar yeah the Lacan so they use very little month Pru because too much monk fruits disgusting so they found this nice balance alright anyways what's going on here what's up guys what are your thoughts on one meal a day diet I'm on my first week and liking it so far says Esteban it's about context right most females I wouldn't recommend one meal a day diet and I don't know I'm not a fan like i don't get clients on one meal a day would you ever go vegan for an experiment says red pill vegan I was a vegan for an experiment 2009-2010 and even some into 2011 but intermittently breaking it so that I could live by getting vitamin b12 yeah I was really into experimenting with all kinds of things I did do a vegan diet an experiment and would not recommend that to any human being who wants to be fertile have children pass their genes on or be healthy vibrant strong and happy alright Jhansi says i was one of over 105 blood glucose my wife just had a baby so yes my sleep is all jacked up right now yeah dude that's it you're not sleeping well you're waking up so one night of poor sleep will give you pre-diabetic blood glucose numbers so you're getting really 105 either poor sleep with a baby you're probably pretty good could be way worse went 120 notorious sob says Facebook blows yeah dick Ulis Facebook's a jokes they all have a Facebook we have a Facebook page for our thing we put the links in there sometimes but man Facebook is toxic this is really like really I mean all right so not just a taquito base right this is like we're talking a lot of keto stuff on this channel it's not just a keto channel so I didn't call it ketogenic edge health it's primal edge health it's about life so that living so I mean not just like the nonsense that goes on in all the keto groups on Facebook right people just repeating ad nauseam disinformation and things they heard people trying to feel good about themselves and appear as a fake authority on the internet like it's just it's insane it's a cesspool in these groups of bad information bad advice judgment infighting bickering and just nonsense but also like as a social thing in general Facebook is completely toxic and is weaponized I mean the Egyptian revolution the color revolution in Egypt these things are are being steamrolled through these social media groups these philanthropists right when you reach super villain level your wikipedia says you're a philanthropist right when you leave read Lex Luthor level savagery your wikipedia says philanthropist Bill Gates philanthropist George Soros I mean these people are starting violent revolutions using Facebook like in Egypt you look at all the color revolutions the way that these things are being used the Arab Spring all this stuff stuff is weaponized this is not here Facebook is a corporation whose bottom line is profit and in the world we live in now which is very different from the world we lived in 15 5 1 5 10 15 20 years ago very very different world very very different the world we live in now in formation data is power of the AI constructs our being crawling the web I mean it's it's ridiculous the amount of social these are like loaded terms right through the only point to what it is but like the amount of power that Facebook has over humanity is absurd frightening right Facebook and Google remember Fahrenheit 451 it burned all the books what are you doing with that Kindle where is all the publishing being consolidated Amazon who decides where the first results are and how important is it to the belief structures insist in and the way that people perceive reality how important is the first thing that pops up on Google when you search something ninety five percent of people believe the first things that pop up on Google is what the truth is what the reality of the world is and we've like we're so distracted by all the nonsense all the news all the fear all the porn all the all this crap right fake posturing the movies about people I'm getting drunk and acting cute all this nonsense and this is the Facebook thing it's just like it's like the new it's like a new layer it's the new the digital ego you get the new fake layer on your personality that you get to filter through to the world and it's it could be so toxic try to lose body fat trying to get healthy off of Facebook and I'm not just saying that because there's bad advice in there like the the group's but it's like this is a tool for social engineering and social control what determines what's at the top of your feet what determines what's allowed to be shared what's advertiser friendly alright alright alastair says don't mention the word fat bomb Tristan will go nuts that bomb the fat bombs mmm I'm out of water all right let's see it she's bringing me water look at me why would I say I'm out of water she walks right up Wow so yeah that means I can go when it first came out it was all exciting you know cool we can share things with everyone but you got to realize now it's tightly controlled now it's really tightly controlled and it's a social control mechanism it is they've basically found a way to get everybody to put a television in their pocket carry it around with them everywhere and alert them to the fake consensus reality social engineering constantly right we have radio and TV filling the newest fear with information and information overload overload now it's our pockets so everyone you went to high school with you're carrying around with your pocket on your little app wonder what Susie's doing you're the [¬†__¬†] when I was in eighth grade I hope she's super unhappy I'm gonna little picture stupid [¬†__¬†] it's like this is break the spell get off social media live life talk to people delete everybody get rid of your the people that you knew in high school from your Facebook your junior high friends it's just keeping you in that same loop feeling oppressed by your insecurities and all this nonsense Alastair says trust me Google MS Facebook Amazon all directly fed into our governments well I'm not sure we're talking are you talking about like NSA stuff that's that's old information we didn't know everything that's been on the Internet is stored every private message we've ever sent every text message all this stuff stored database through NSA are you saying that they're all funded by and the seed money came through the same I don't know you're saying but yeah thanks for the comments guys Kukulcan says Facebook is about profit over consequence a lot of America systems all that profit over consequence but that's an oversimplification to yes the the bottom line is profit but when you get a certain amount of money money stops mattering and it's just about power right so Facebook at this point it's like you don't need profit true it doesn't like it's it's a tool for social engineering it's the most it's the most powerful social engineering tool that you could ever have and surveillance tool which feeds the social engineering loop right you watch the trends you see the trends you feed the trends you direct the trends through language live in a world built around language built by language Brian Street says once you shake loose that sugar addiction your brain will be like on superpower fuel you'll be shocked how awake you feel though right on TS Odin Sun what's up dude hmm all right all right says somebody says YouTube is heading the same way as Facebook YouTube 'he's there come on now Google who owns YouTube Google it's there and open this they're openly censoring there's open censorship now the Eric Schmidt of Google has publicly stated that he is interested in social engineering Eric Schmidt has openly stated this in an interview on television that he looks at himself as doing social engineering work creating augmented humanity hmm all right boom boo-boom all right nightshifts who's working a night shift what's going on here all right let's see where as what are you guys doing what's going on here someone's talking about a night shift but I don't know I lost the thing Alasdair well that's up what are you talking about tree-hugging hmm Tony says the sad part is that Facebook will continue to grow when the big companies start putting their advertisement dollars into it rather than traditional venues like TV but it can only grow if people keep feeding it right unfortunately most most people want to go with the crowd well most people you know from a young age we learned that we and this is natural to want to be accepted right into your family by your parents to do want to be loved by your community to want to be accepted for who you are but then there's an entire system made to make you feel the opposite of that right to make you feel insecure to make you feel like you're not good enough to make you feel like there's something wrong with you an advertisement preys upon that unfortunately I mean Facebook is one of the biggest outlets for people it's like it's it's an amazing social phenomenon it's the most fascinating social phenomena technological social interface there's ever been you know radio and television were huge for spreading propaganda I mean initially like all television and radio that the first things that they were used for are where there's propaganda war propaganda you've seen the old Disney films of uh you know the anti German anti-japanese pro-american war machine Disney films and you know telling people to make your Victory Gardens and stuff like that you know the the film reels before the movies giving you the footage of of the great war spreading the mythology good-versus-evil us-versus-them trading freedom for security you know and this is this is what television and radio were first used for when television was first invented in Germany pre World War two and it was viewed as the ultimate weapon for social control I mean Hitler was well as wet in his pants over this you know it was the ultimate tool the first symbol sent through the television was a interesting is a Maltese Cross but is the yeah I mean if you look at the history of all these things it's you're saying Facebook's gonna become like conventional TV it always was man it's like yeah we got we got like a nice fake high from oh we get to share information like you go on Facebook you can like you could share anything like the people are gonna start to learn more to learn more about the truth about reality about people are gonna be exposed to things that are not just the fake TV narrative great but you know I don't know it's not like there's a top-down thing two people asked for it people want security than want acceptance I go saying earlier I got distracted by myself people want to feel accepted it's an entire social propaganda social engineering system they make you feel like you're up there something wrong with you like you're you know you should feel insecure and then market you nonsense and fill that emptiness with things that'll keep you in that loop making you feel more empty well here's a bunch of porn so jerk yourself off or here's some drugs here's some oxy cotton here's some anti-anxiety meds this will keep you know these things just they feed into the loop of addiction trying to fill ourselves with illusion to comfort ourselves when really it's like the comforters right there for us the comforters could be within us right the kingdom of heaven is at hand the kingdom of heaven is at hand what does that mean what does something is at hand it's like it's right there hello it's right there it's right in front of us we get distracted by the nonsense and get distracted by the fear distracted by the jealousies the anger the greed all this stuff then we sell little bits of that essence that's in there that's so beautiful and true and real and it gets filled with Miley Cyrus going from abused child to abused adult basically a [¬†__¬†] to see Miley Cyrus go from innocent little Hannah Montana squeaky clean to like doing whatever it is that she does now that I probably wouldn't even want to speak out loud in front of my children in front of crowds of people with the right hand signs and everything all these mmm so that I mean this it is what it is right it is what it is we detached from that we stopped paying attention to the nonsense to the things that make us feel filthy inside and then we connect to what's good what's righteous what's true look into each other's eyes speak to each other share our vulnerabilities with each other and build something that we desire not something that we're engineered to think we desire like a big slave grid or everybody's walking around with their face and their freakin phones scared to death of everyone around them and everything around them all right let's move on let's talk about diet talk about football Kim Kardashian's ass is so luscious I want to be like her oh right Christina says Tristan could go vegan fair I've been a vegan been there done that ma vegans do your thing don't come preach veganism here come on data scraping from all the major players then use this big data at a profile yeah it's not just big data there's very advanced AI being worked on for all different reasons that can be utilized for all different purposes and so valley alright let's let's move on guys Tristan is there a good recipe for sourdough bread in your cookbook sourdough bread sourdough is a fermented wheat thing I was like you to take wheat and you mix it with a special culture and it ferments it and your name is Tristan with a why that's pretty cool oh you know a tryst that's like a battle or like you're involved in a tryst you know a conflict I'm just a try Stan but you're a warrior Tristan you're battling sourdough bread there's several there's a bunch of bread recipes but look sourdough bread is a thing you ferment the wheat this is great it's Pavlov's dog each time we mention sugar Tristan takes a drink Tristan is it wise to consume fat sugar wise and consume fat when starting out a keto lifestyle even though I have 20 pounds of fat to lose yeah you have to consume fat no matter what you're eating right is it wise to consume 250 grams of fat no for you you got 20 pounds to lose maybe for the first week do a little bit of uh for the first week there you go come on here and complain and you get blocked talk about what I want to talk about talk about keto now you talk about nothing Fabian consiglio cockroach get out of here Mike all right doo-doo-doo yeah yeah so you want to eat some fat but not an astronomical amount of fat get adapted eat enough fat around maintenance then drop your fat calories back after that is there a cap to protein grams per meal to avoid gluconeogenesis good question gluconeogenesis is not substrate driven gluconeogenesis is demand driven meaning your body will make glucose from the backbone of fatty acids or from amino acids that are gluco genic when it needs to not just because those amino acids are present they did studies where they injected those amino acids straightened in the bloodstream still doesn't increase gluconeogenesis although I guess it could be argued that that's not a natural way of administering these amino acids and that once it goes through the liver because the liver is alright just to feed it by own argument but anyways there's people who eat check out some of these like all meat people man they're still getting super high ketones with huge meals of like 100 grams of protein and a meal and their register and ketones laughter now protein will clouds arise and glucagon will cause an insulin spike much less so than carbohydrate but also why are you worried about here let's get to the basis of this let's get to the real thing here why are you worried about avoiding gluconeogenesis you need to do gluconeogenesis to live so why are you worried about avoiding it eating more protein doesn't make you make more glucose eating any solid foods can make glucagon get released because you're these beta cells and your gut and your stomach rather that actually tell your body to release glucagon so that'll raise your blood sugar for a little bit after the meal but it's transient and it's contextual so if you're having one meal a day like somebody recommend or not recommended like someone was asking about earlier which I don't necessarily recommend everybody but hey look if it works for you it works for you it's not about what I use on my clients or what my Dogma is it's what works in your life so if you're doing one meal a day it's gonna have more protein than someone's reading three meals a day and you're gonna have a different level of ketones and whatnot not that that's even important not that we should be focusing and worrying about that because it's a distraction for most people so yeah why are you worried about gluconeogenesis you probably don't need to be and there's not really a cap and but yeah if Cortina will release glucagon and insulin which will stop the production of ketones temporarily is that a big deal no cuz its natural what's not natural is measuring your blood ketones 10 times a day chasing ketones pretending that that is the measure of you know progress measured progress is not how much ketone do I have in my blood just like if you're on a carbohydrate based diet you're not measuring your blood glucose all the time thinking woohoo 120 I'm killing it no it doesn't work how do you feel about bone brother bone broth I can guessing that was like autocorrect Lori I like bone broth I feel strongly about bone broth it's delicious alastair says I was a cop for 10 years work night shift really hard to eat well and properly but my tip would be it's all about the preparation then you're not tempted to go be ID right on that alastair thanks for the comment my friend where can I shift as a cop it's got to be like one of the most stressful jobs in the world right not only are like then you know you're working a night shift which disrupt your circadian rhythm makes your blood sugar go crazy causes more inflammation but also you're like one of the most difficult jobs in the world the people you're dealing with on the night shift as a cop are never happy to see you dude glad you survived it thanks for tuning in man alastair wait what's up that was Dick Alastair do you have a copy of the key tuna catch cookbook Alice there's like offering all these people advice as I just babble about whatever I want yeah Alice there you got a copy of the ketogenic Edge cookbook if you don't have a copy of it if you don't have a copy of it I want to hook you up where you add a house there all right what's going on guys your opinion on the elderly doing Kido yeah totally I mean for cognitive decline for you know maintaining stable brain chemistry for hopefully moving forward in their life without things like Alzheimer's and you know these there are neurodegenerative diseases I think a ketogenic diet or definitely like a low-carb high-fat diet it's fantastic could you explain what an adaptogen is slash does an adaptogen is a class of herbs that is non-toxic and that helps the body to adapt to stress meaning that something like so maca is an adaptogen form for instance maca can help balance the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis so if you're not creating enough stress hormones through your adrenals maca will support your adrenals and allow you to create more if you're creating too many maca will help you to reduce that level through balancing the HPA axis so adaptogens work through balancing out body chemistry so they don't necessarily you know it's gonna make this go up or this go down no they help to balance out the system and they seem to have a powerful effect on the immune system are you serious the EPA's got a hurricane right now are you freaking kidding me three killed in Ireland oh man I'm sorry anybody out there watching from the UK hang in there that's that's ridiculous when was the last hurricane there why are we using this technology that's like all these patents for weather modification why aren't these being used to stop these things that's crazy why are we having a public conversation about weather modification this has been going like since the night since the early 1900s leather has been modified hurricanes can be created and stopped with technology oh man alright okay okay what's going on here if someone who eats no animals is a vegan what do you call someone who eats Kido lol someone who eats Kido people called him me ello even though I hate these denominations altogether because the loss of context at often ensues although I suppose their odds starting place I don't know it's that one okay come on now alright there's so many comments here alright everybody kukulcan says Tristan you sometimes talking about having a crooked spine or hips do you think this can be caused by being asymmetrical alright that's a great question so having crooked hips scoliosis can this be caused by being asymmetrical I think in most cases it's not a genetic thing I think in most cases oh man Tristan in the UK says it's getting rough there I know hang in there man all right on everybody should be you know praying for the people of the UK I hope you guys are protected and and guided through this and safe and yeah I'm sorry that sucks a hurricane in the UK hurricane in the UK it sounds like a Sex Pistols b-side alright alright let's see crooked spine and hips is usually are used born asymmetrical I don't believe so I think my hips I know my hips are crooked because I was very dominant on one foot I grew up playing baseball so swinging about one direction popping my hips one way just very soon it feels good and I've got all the muscle memory going that way right so it's like swing the bat baseball yeah but you know left-handed it's different like I you know the muscle I don't have the neurological balance there to actually do that also sitting in desks all the time leaning over the desk and then I had in major injuries and also skateboarding right jumping off my right foot like millions I don't know like how many kick flips have I done in my life and it's just the same motion over and over again jumping off of one leg kicking with the other leg and of super unnatural really weird angles and thousands of times never stretching before it never like doing rehab stuff after because that's for jocks right now you get like you just like doing the same thing or like I'm cool because I do this so it's how you didn't think it was cool to do that kind of stuff but um just crazy so it's ya know read we read regular so I kick with my left foot on a skateboard but I kick with my right foot when I play soccer so um yeah you I can ride switch but not I can't kick flip switch I can't anyone can like you could ride around used to do that you should ride around switch all the time but it still wasn't balanced because when I really wanted to haul ass or really want to go fast or wanted to do something or like all your you know move I'd go regular so super unbalanced and even just like riding down the road switch I'd be dominant on my right foot and it just feel really weird to get on that left leg so the faucet issue and the deep connective tissue in my hips is like one of my hips is one of my legs is kind of twisted under and the hamstring is shortened because of where the where it sits with a connective tissue so it's a physiological usage thing rather than just like oh and I was born that way like I don't believe that I gotta buy into that I don't buy into that like oh you're you've got scoliosis you're asymmetrical you can't change it I've seen that just repositioning my hips and standing with proper posture neurologically wiring up my body to be more straight fixes pain inflammation in the hips and gets my spine much straighter so it's a it's a usage thing it's a neurological thing part of it comes from the traumatic injury you know injury to spinal cord is basically traumatic brain injury right so traumatic brain injury you know all kinds of there's a poor diet as a kid to you know me inflammation in the gut meaning disconnection from the FASTA tissue and the networks that go from the spinal cord wrap around all of the organs and hold the pelvic girdle there so it's like all of these different things that I had going on with my life which I'll take full responsibility for all of them it's like that's what I think it is that's why my body was crooked you're talking about crooked bones from asymmetry sure someone could maybe have like one femurs longer than the other but you could still physiologically use your body in a way that you'd be balanced rider woke up so yeah and I think we're locked in or it's like all its genetic right it's like your tattoo but diabetic its genetic so now I'm tied to diabetic because I'm 250 pounds my dad was 250 pounds and so was my mom this is like epigenetic it's not genetic not doomed by my genetics how long is your deck you mean how wide is my dad I like at 8.5 big-boy deck because I like I like how it feels when you have a bigger wider deck and you you ollie or you kickflip it just feels heavy right all right do-do-do-do-do alright guys so talked about a lot today talk about optimizing circadian rhythm we talked about formulating macros kind of troubleshooting high blood glucose in the morning and it was funny because my my guess was right the dude wasn't getting very much sleep because like my lovely wife he had a baby hollering in his ear in the middle of the night in sleep very well talk about all kinds of stuff I got to rant and rave about why Facebook is wack and why people should get off of Facebook and stop subjecting themselves to the social engineering that happens there and also how we need a new YouTube let's get a new YouTube guys so we'll make a new YouTube that's not censored that's not monetized calling me tube and you know what else we talked about we talked about the upcoming release of the ultimate guide to low-carb mother flippin baking

Timestamps: 
0:00 Why do some diabetics get gangrene?
0:30 The reason the tissue is dying is because of exposure to way too much sugar
2:50 I explain what you can do for gangrene


In this video, I answer the question of why do some diabetics get gangrene while others don‚Äôt? 


With gangrene, the tissue in the toes or foot, and sometimes the hand, starts turning black, yellow, red, and sometimes even a shade of green. The word gangrene is derived from the Latin word that means putrefaction, or dead or dying tissue. And the reason the tissue is dying is that it‚Äôs being exposed to way too much sugar.


When you expose your vascular system to too much glucose, it gets damaged. You get massive oxidation, creating free radicals. You experience hemorrhaging clotting and a thickened stiffened vascular system. All of this causes a healing response; an inflammatory response, and impairs the blood flow to your tissues and nerves.


The lining of your vascular system is called the endothelial layer. It doesn‚Äôt require insulin to transport glucose into the cells. This means if you have insulin resistance, you won‚Äôt have the resistance in the endothelial layer. If there‚Äôs too much glucose it will be driven right into your tissues, which is why so much damage is created. 


If you look at insulin resistance as a protective mechanism that prevents too much glucose and insulin from going into the tissues, it‚Äôs easy to see why tissues that don‚Äôt need insulin to get battered. Brain tissue is another example, along with red blood cells. When you get an A1C test, what‚Äôs measured is a level of exposure to sugar of the red blood cells, to determine whether or not you‚Äôre a diabetic. 


The more sugar in your blood, the more vascular problems you‚Äôll have. It‚Äôll stop both the nutrition and oxygen to your tissues, leading to gangrene. You may get a combination of gangrene, ulcers, and nerve damage. 


But here‚Äôs what you can do. The most important thing is to avoid it in the first place, by not consuming so much sugar. Do keto and intermittent fasting. 


If you already have this condition there are a couple of things you can do depending on how severe it is. Believe it or not, in 2004 the FDA approved maggot therapy. Maggots are put into skin ulcers to clean up the dead tissue, and it‚Äôs very effective because it disinfects the area and stimulates healing. The maggots actually release enzymes and a broad-spectrum antibiotic. 


Of course, you also want to change your diet to lower your sugar intake.


Now you know the answer to why do some diabetics get gangrene?

diabetics get gangrene okay and others don't first of all what is gangrene it really has nothing to do with the color green but when you get gangrene the tissue usually in the feet or the toes start first and then sometimes in the hand start turning black yellow red and even kind of a shade of green now the actual word gangrene comes from the Latin word which means putrefaction dead or dying tissue and the reason why the tissue is dying is simply because you're exposing the tissue with way too much sugar okay so if your blood sugar is too high that sugar goes to the vascular system and the tiny little blood vessels especially starting in the toes and sometimes in the hands because you start off from the heart with larger blood vessels and then it gets down to the bottom of the feet to the tiny capillaries then it comes back through the venous system but when you expose glucose to your vascular system you get all sorts of destruction you get massive oxidation creates free radicals hemorrhaging so you're getting bleeding getting clotting the the vascular system is becoming thicker and stiffer and you're getting a healing response inflammatory response and all of this is going to stop the blood flow to the tissues and to the nerves now the lining on the inside of the vascular system is called the endothelial layer and this layer does not require insulin to transport glucose into those cells which means that if you have insulin resistance you won't have any resistance there if there's too much glucose it's going to drive it right into the tissues and that's really what's creating the damage if you look at insulin resistance as a protective mechanism to block insulin and glucose from going in the tissues because it's toxic large amounts and there's certain tissues that don't require insulin and those usually get hammered okay the brain cells for example don't require insulin you have the brain blood barrier which does but not the actual brain cells the red blood cells don't require insulin this is why when you get a test with called a1c they're measuring the amount of exposure of that sugar to the red blood cell to determine if you're a diabetic or not so the more sugar in the blood the more vascular problems you're gonna have and that's gonna stop the nutrition to the tissues and the oxygen to the tissues and it's gonna start dying and that's what's called gangrene so you have a combination of dead tissue ulcers and severe nerve damage a lot of times there's pain involved until the nerve is dead and then you have no pain it's completely numb now what could be done for this condition well the most important thing is to avoid this in the first place by not consuming so much sugar okay doing Kido and I have so you never end up in the situation but if you already have this situation there might be a couple things that you can do depending on how severe it is let's say you don't want to get surgery and remove your toes okay and maybe you have certain tissues that are not so bad maybe you have an ulcer or some infection well guess what the FDA did approve in 2004 maggot therapy and I'm not I'm not being sarcastic they actually put maggots in the ulcer to clean up the dead tissue certain types of maggots eat the dead tissue and they don't eat the healthy tissue so they clear out the infection interesting in fact they're finding that it's even more effective than certain surgeries because it disinfects the area and it stimulates healing and within one or two days it could be totally cleaned out so these maggots actually release enzymes and they also release like a broad-spectrum antibiotic to kill HUF the infection is quite interesting but of course you would want to make sure that you change your diet so you don't keep exposing these tissues to glucose you don't want to just rely on medication to control your blood sugars medication basically takes the excess blood sugar and in it has to put it somewhere it doesn't evaporate it lowers it but it puts it somewhere in the in the tissues but we want to actually eliminate the sugar from the the other thing that I would recommend especially if you're getting let's say you're getting nerve damage but maybe it's not gangrene yet is to start taking benfotiamine but in folk too mean is a B vitamin that is made into a fat soluble version so it penetrates the myelin sheath it goes right into the nerves and actually can help to protect against the high sugar and the complications and it's great for peripheral neuropathy it's called benfotiamine get some take like four tablets a day spread out and you'll see some really wonderful changes with that anyway I wanted to create this video to explain why diabetics get gangrene and

Metabolic disorders that are associated with a high blood sugar and glucose are collectively known as Diabetes Mellitus which you will see abbreviated as:  DM. Reasons for high sugar level can be too little insulin produced by the body or the body cells can not respond to insulin properly or it can be both.
Most of the ingested food is broken down into a sugar known as glucose which then goes to the bloodstream and acts as the major source of energy in the body. It allows the body cells to grow and sustain. But in order to enter the cells, glucose needs a hormone known as insulin which is produced by the pancreas.
     Every time we eat and food is broken down into glucose, pancreas react by producing insulin according to the level of glucose in the blood. Insulin then carries the glucose from the blood into different cells around the body, reducing the level of glucose in the bloodstream. Generally, concentration of glucose in the blood fluctuates between 70-110 mg/dL in a normal individual.
     Diabetes mellitus occurs when the pancreas does not produce sufficient insulin, or the cells do not respond to insulin; in both cases glucose stays in the bloodstream due to which not only the level of blood glucose stays high but also cells do not receive sufficient glucose. These conditions manifest symptoms of Diabetes mellitus. Initially, cells lack sufficient fuel to sustain but prolonged high blood sugar results in organ failure, in which major organs such as heart, kidneys, eyes, nerve cells and blood vessels stop functioning.

There are 3 types of Diabetes Mellitus:
1. Type 1 Diabetes: is when pancreas cannot produce sufficient insulin. This type of DM is considered an autoimmune condition, as the patient‚Äôs body destroys its own beta cells in the pancreas that are responsible for the production of insulin. As pancreas is unable to produce insulin, type 1 DM is managed by injecting insulin to maintain a normal blood sugar level; which is why in the past it was known as insulin-dependent diabetes. About 15% of diabetic patients have type 1 DM.

2.  Type 2 Diabetes: is when the cells do not respond to insulin properly, leading to what is called insulin resistance."	145000.0	PT14M	2d	sd	False		0.0			101208.0	895.0	0.0	105.0	2011-02-02T02:52:57Z	EmpoweRN	15347875.0	hi guys welcome back to empower and my name is caroline porter thomas thank you so much as usual for watching my videos so in this video we're going to go over disease process that you will see a lot as a nurse no matter where you work and that is called diabetes mellitus so just like the other video what we're going to do is instead of doing and click style questions at the end of this video and making a super long overwhelming video where we all feel very rushed and we're not able to fully answer the question as we finish editing the questions we're going to post the questions individually so make sure you subscribe to the channel and also sign up for email updates to get updated immediately so without any further ado let's get started and let's go over diabetes mellitus diabetes mellitus metabolic disorders that are associated with high blood sugar and glucose are collectively known as diabetes mellitus which you will see abbreviated as DM reasons for high blood sugar level can be too little insulin produced by the body or the body cells that cannot respond to insulin properly or it can be a mixture of both most of the ingested food is broken down into sugar known as glucose which Ben goes into the bloodstream and acts as the major source of energy in the body it allows the body cells to grow and sustain but in order to enter the cells glucose needs a hormone which is known as insulin which is produced by the pancreas every time we eat and food is broken down into glucose the pancreas reacts by producing insulin according to the level of glucose and the blood and slim then carries the glucose from the blood into different cells around the body reducing the level of glucose in the bloodstream generally concentration of glucose in the blood fluctuates between about 70 to 110 in a normal individual diabetes mellitus occurs on the pancreas does not produce sufficient insulin or the cells do not respond to the insulin in both cases glucose stays in the bloodstream due to which not only the levels in the blood glucose stay high but also the cells do not receive sufficient glucose these conditions and the best symptoms of diabetes mellitus initially cells lack sufficient fuel to sustain but prolonged periods of high blood sugar results in organ failure in which major organs such as heart kidneys eyes nerve cells and blood vessel can be damaged or fail to function eventually there are three types of diabetes mellitus type 1 is when the pancreas cannot provide sufficient insulin this type of diabetes mellitus is considered an autoimmune condition as the patient's body destroys its own beta cells in the pancreas that are responsible for the production of insulin as the pancreas is unable to produce insulin type 1 diabetes is managed by injecting insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels which is why it is usually referred to as insulin dependent it is also usually referred to as juvenile onset about 15% of all diabetic patients have type 1 and type 2 diabetes is when the cells do not respond to insulin properly leading to what is called insulin resistance the cells do not use insulin properly so sugar levels in the blood stay high causing the pancreas to produce extra insulin to compensate for the resistance but the cells continue to developing further resistance and eventually the pancreas fails to produce sufficient insulin to meet the body's requirements this condition occurs in people that are older than 30 years of age and is linked with obesity and 80 to 90% of the cases and the early stages of this type of diabetes can be controlled by proper diet and physical exercise patients may also need medications like insulin and metformin to reduce the level of glucose in the blood about 85% of diabetes patients have type 2 type 3 diabetes this is called gestational diabetes and is the third type gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy and females in some women the concentration of glucose and the blood is relatively high and their bodies do not produce sufficient insulin due to which most of the glucose does not enter the cells hence keeping the blood sugar levels high generally the type of diabetes is managed with appropriate diet and I exercise but in about 10 to 20 percent of patients may require some type of treatment to maintain blood sugar levels if gestational diabetes is left uncontrolled the patient may face complications to the infants both in gestation and advert the newborn may also be larger than normal signs and symptoms signs and symptoms are almost the same for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes there are three typical symptoms they are polydipsia which means an abnormal thirst sensation polyuria frequent urination and polyphagia which means excessive appetite when the cells cannot use blood glucose due to insufficient insulin they survive by breaking down the fats from the cells this mechanism produces compounds known as ketones all those cells obtain energy from ketones but it also makes the blood highly acidic hence resulting in the condition known as diabetic ketoacidosis this condition then generates certain symptoms as well that includes nausea vomiting deep and rapid breathing which is also known as COO Shmuel breathing fatigue weight loss abdominal pain and the smell of acetone in the breath and the bad taste in the mouth normally ketosis is observed in type one diabetes only because in type 2 diabetes the pancreas produces insulin and some amount of glucose manages to enter the cells however level of glucose and the blood still stays much higher than it should be which can result in extreme dehydration this condition is known as non atonic hyper lie see me Oh a smaller syndrome it produces symptoms such as drowsiness mental confusion and possibly seizures complications all types of diabetes mellitus are associated with long term complications that usually develop over a period of 10 to 20 years the severity of the risk depends on how long the individual has had diabetes and also how it was managed affected areas include the blood patients become very vulnerable to infections particularly in the skin and urinary tract which can be spread through the blood and once infected it can become very severe much easier and it takes much longer to overcome the infection the skin can also be infected the skin can develop ulcers and can slow recovery from rooms which can cause infections especially in the legs and feet slow or almost no recovery from wounds leaves amputations as a last resort the blood vessels are also affected the blood vessels are affected due to poor blood circulation which also means slow recovery from wounds and hence susceptibility to infections it can also result in heart attack stroke erectile disfunction and gangrene of the hands and feet diabetes can also affect the kidney by pausing renal dysfunction and eventually kidney failure the eyes the eyes are also affected causing decline in eyesight and eventually leading to potential blindness nerves in many cases the nerves are also affected causing a gradual or sudden weakness in the legs altered sensation tingling numbness or pain may be felt diagnosis diabetes mellitus is associated with hyperglycemia that can be perpetual or reoccurring there are certain tests to detect hyperglycemia that include the following an oral glucose tolerance test this is when the patient has to fast for the night prior to the test after which his fasting blood sugar level is measured then the patient is given a particular glucose solution of a standard high concentration to drink for the next two to three hours the blood sugar levels are checked tested and recorded periodically fasting blood sugars can also be used for this patient has to fast the night prior to the test and in the morning a blood sample will be drawn and tested for hyperglycemia glycol 80 kima globin is also known as hemoglobin a1c is a test under high concentrations of glucose this test is used to measure the amounts of blood glucose that attaches to the hemoglobin molecule and the results can provide information about the patient's average blood sugar level over the past two to three months so it's much more accurate management and treatment treatment of diabetes is focused on controlling blood sugar levels and maintaining it within a normal range it is achieved by monitoring the blood sugar level modifying a diet and exercise and medications or insulin when necessary these measures control the blood sugar and reduce the risk of complications or at least delay them lifestyle changes lifestyle changes include physical exercise and appropriate diet these suggests a diet should keep blood sugar levels low and it should be intended for weight loss it is found that a low glycemic index diet helps maintain blood sugar levels physical exercise also prevents obesity as well as controls blood sugar levels exercise can include aerobics such as dancing and walking or resistance training such as yoga and weightlifting it is more effective to perform a combination of several different exercises instead of only one type about 30 minutes a day of aerobic exercises most days of the week will be quite effective however it initially can be started light and be intensified over time insulin replacement almost all diabetic patients with type 1 and some with type 2 diabetes need insulin injections these injections are inject into the fat layer under the skin usually in the arm or thigh or abdominal wall insulin cannot be taken orally because stomach acids destroy the insulin types of insulin fast-acting insulin fast-acting insulin after being injected into the subcutaneous fat layer is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream it is helpful during snacks and mills to prevent elevated blood sugar levels there are two types of fats acting insulin rapid acting insulin which starts working 15 minutes after the injection and in about one hour reaches its peak and remains effective for two to four hours it is used in conjunction with long-acting insulin examples of short-acting insulin include insulin aspart which is also known as novalog insulin and insulin list Pro which is also known as Humalog regular or short acting insulin after injected normally enters the blood in about 30 minutes and it Peaks in about two to three hours which is when the injection reaches the optimum activity it will continue to work for about 3 to 6 hours this type of insulin can be injected prior to meals examples of this type of insulin include novel and art and human art intermedia acts and so on this type of insulin lasts longer and they will take longer to be absorbed in the bloodstream that is about two to four hours after the injection it reaches its maximum activity after about four to twelve hours and continues to work for about 12 to 18 hours it can be used between meals while fasting or overnight it is sometimes used along with rapid or short acting insulin examples include Noble and in or in pH and human and long-acting insulin long-acting insulin absorption time for this type of insulin is long it enters the blood after many hours of injection its peak activity is also minimal showing a study plateau effect that remains throughout the day which means it works slowly and evenly reducing blood levels over a 24-hour period long-acting insulin can be used between meals while fasting or overnight along with rapid or short-acting insulin examples of this insulin include Lance's and love Emir premix insulin is a mixture of intermediate acting and short acting insulin solutions which is generally injected prior to meals twice a day it is meant for individuals who cannot read dosage and directions or who are unable to mix solutions themselves anti hyperglycemic drugs patients especially with type 2 diabetes can take anti hyperglycemic drugs to control blood sugar levels these drugs do not help type one diabetic patients but can lower blood sugar levels and type two diabetic patients to a significant amount it is usually given to these patients in cases where physical exercise and dietary changes fail to lower blood Sugar's levels sufficiently these drugs come in tablet form and tablets are taken orally before or after meals or as suggested by the doctor examples include metformin Actos pre coast and januvia monitoring treatment monitoring treatment includes keeping a close check on the diabetic patients blood sugar levels it is the most significant part of management and treatment of diabetes diabetic patients should change their eating habits and diet they should also exercise regularly and take insulin or medications on time to avoid high blood glucose levels keeping a check up on blood sugar levels helps to understand the changes required to maintain a normal blood sugar level with the help of monitoring devices like continuous glucose monitoring systems and glucose meters anyone can monitor their blood sugar level at home or anywhere

_TnDr8cKums	UCPyMN8DzkFl2__xnTEiGZ1w	27.0	How to Read a Syringe 3 ml, 1 ml, Insulin, & 5 ml/cc | Reading a Syringe Plunger	"Learn how to read a syringe: This video will explain how to read different nursing syringe sizes such as the 3 mL, 1 mL, 5 mL, 10 mL, and Insulin syringes (100 units).

As the nurse, it is very important you know how to correctly read a syringe when drawing up medications.

A syringe consists of various parts such as the adapter (which is where you draw up and injection the medication), barrel (which has a scale on it that allows you to measure the medication), plunger (which assists in drawing up and measuring the medication).

Syringes consist of different measuring scales. For example, most 3 mL syringes measure each line as 0.1 mL, while 1 mL syringes measure each line as 0.01 mL. A 3 mL syringe is best for giving medications that require you draw up 0.5 mL of a medication. While a 1 mL syringe is best for giving medications that require you draw up small amounts like 0.25 mL.

and it measures onward now one thing that you want to keep in mind is how to actually measure the fluid that you're drawing up with this plunger so let's go over the other part the plunger I'm going to take it out so you can see it the plunger has a top part and a bottom part and it also has a beveled area and whenever you're actually drawing up the medication you're going to line the line up that's on the scale of your barrel with this top part of the plunger not the beveled part the top part now let's go over how to read each syringe first we're going to start with the easiest syringe which is the 10 milliliter or 10 cc syringe and as you can tell on this picture each area is measured out so the top part where the top line is 0.5 milliliters then it goes to one then the next line is 1.5 then it goes to two then the next line is 2.5 and so on so this syringe based on how its scale is set up in its capacity it measures by 0.5 now let's test your knowledge based on the yellow wine what is the measurement of this syringe and the answer is 4.5 MLS now let's look at the five milliliter syringe and as you can see on this this has a little bit more lines in between the main measurements than the 10 cc syringe and that very top line is zero and then below zero you have 0.2 then point four seven point six point eight and then the huge line is one so that is where one milliliter is at then after that you'll count by twos the point twos so to be 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 and 2 and then so on it would keep measuring that a male until you hit 5 MLS now let's look at this syringe based on the yellow wine what is the measurement of this syringe the answer is 2.2 MLS now let's look at our 3 no leader syringe this syringe even further breaks down the measurement so you can really draw up a smaller amount of a medication for instance like I said at the beginning of the video this syringe is really good for drawing up a medication if you just have to give point five of something so that top line is zero then as you pull the plunger down this syringe goes down by point one so you have 0.1 ml 0.2 0.3 0.4 and then you have half 0.5 then you have point six point seven point eight point nine and then one and then so on until you get a total capacity of three MLS based on the yellow wine what is the measurement of this syringe the answer is 0.7 MLS our next syringe is the one milliliter syringe and this syringe if you don't have good eyesight you really have to squint to see the little lines but it's really good for giving those medications where you have to give just a little bit like the 0.25 MLS okay on this syringe as you can see and the top line will be zero and then this particular syringe will measure down by 0.01 so you have point zero one point zero two point zero three onward until you hit point one ml's and then it'll just keep on going until you've hit a total capacity of 1 in MLS based on the yellow wine what is the measurement of this syringe the answer is 0.25 MLS okay this is our very last syringe and this is a syringe that you will be using a lot whenever you are giving diabetics insulin and it is a syringe that holds a total of a hundred units because insulin is measured in units and it looks a little similar to our one milliliter syringe that we went over but it's not measured in milliliters it's measured in units so as you can see with this we have our top line which is zero and this is going to measure in increments of two so the next line would be two units then four units six units eight units and then ten units and then onward until you would give a total of a hundred units based on the yellow wine what is the measurement of this syringe the answer is 72 units okay so that wraps up this video on how to read the common syringes you will encounter as a nurse thank you so much for watching and don't forget to subscribe to our channel for more videos	High Medical Info

More info on #kidneys and #kidneydisease :

‚Äì Kidneys filter around 180 litres of blood every day, control the production of red blood cells and release hormones that regulate your blood pressure. Kidneys also produce urine, by removing waste products from the body.

‚Äì Kidneys help keep your bones strong and healthy by helping produce an active form of vitamin D.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) means that your kidneys do not work as well as they should. They can‚Äôt remove waste products from your body. 

‚Äì Damage to the kidney‚Äôs filter system can also allow blood and protein to leak into the urine. This is not always visible but can be found with a urine test. The term ‚Äòchronic‚Äô means that it is a long-term condition. It does not necessarily mean your kidney damage is severe as many cases of CKD are mild and can be managed with help from your GP and without hospital involvement.

‚Äì Anyone could get kidney disease. Around 3 million people in the UK have Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Uncontrolled diabetes and high blood pressure are the biggest causes of CKD. Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities are five times more likely to develop CKD than other groups.


‚Äì Right now, over 68,000 people in the UK are being treated for kidney failure (also known as stage 5 CKD, where kidney function is less than 15%). There are 40-45,000 premature deaths in the UK every year due to CKD (that's enough people to fill the Royal Albert Hall nine times over).

‚Äì Most people are diagnosed by a blood and urine test. You may have these tests as part of a routine check-up or because you are at risk of developing CKD"	1.0	PT1M1S	2d	hd	False		0.0			53.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	2022-03-03T16:54:41.797443Z	Hidden-CKD	436.0	[Music] foreign [Music] could you summarize your project in three words yes so the first one is reduce we know that Kidney Health inequalities is higher among black and ethnic minority so reduce Health inequalities among high-risk communities the second is e which is Empower so empower the community members to empower each other so that they are able to self-care the third one is promote Kidney Health Awareness within the community so that more people will engage with Kidney Health and get to know how well the academies are I would especially want to appeal to all the black and ethnic minority people particularly African and Caribbean people those of us who have high blood pressure diabetes please do not take that for granted find out how well is your kidney	Low Medical Info

Ramiro Mercado, MD, a Chicago-based AMITA Health family medicine doctor, treats many families who have immigrated from Latin American countries and he has observed how their diets change as a result. Exposed to new and less nutritious foods, Latino families often see their weight, blood sugar and cholesterol levels rise. Most heartbreakingly, Dr. Mercado has seen children with the cholesterol levels of an adult. He has also witnessed an alarming prevalence of child obesity in the population he serves (5 out of every 10 kids, by his estimate).

Dr. Mercado sees it as his duty to teach his Latino patients how to maintain a healthy diet, emphasizing fresh vegetables, fruits and grains over meat and fried foods. Good diet, paired with education and exercise, is one of the best preventives of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and other morbidities that can disproportionately affect Latino communities.

_eTAUmqG7b8	UC--uZM69O3nbaOt4tgWUeYw	22.0	GIS Q&A - Dr. John Bienvenu: How is gastroparesis treated?	"The way we treat gastroparesis is to first make the diagnosis, and generally we do that with the combination of an upper endoscopy and imaging studies. In this case, we do what‚Äôs called a gastric emptying study to see how quickly food leaves the stomach or how long it stays in there. Once the diagnosis is made, then we need to go about treating it. One of the first modalities we use to treat gastroparesis, especially if you‚Äôre a diabetic, is to get a patient‚Äôs blood sugar under tight control because poorly controlled blood sugar results in increased and worse symptoms of gastroparesis. Additionally, we enact lifestyle changes. We have the patient eat small, frequent, low-volume, low-fat and low-fiber meals because high-fiber and high-fat meals tend to be hard to digest, and that impairs the emptying of the stomach. Additionally, we can put the patients on a handful of different medications that we use to try to improve the rate of gastric emptying and improve their symptoms.

And every other person you see may have diabetes, So very often we have these question that what is normal blood glucose level, because apart from diabetes we also have  condition called pre-diabetes, that is were there is a high risk of developing diabetes but diabetes actually not there. So the Normal Blood Glucose Level is If you look at the fasting blood sugar level if you give the blood sample in the fasting stage and if the fasting glucose level is less than 100 it is normal. If it is 100 to 125 that is called as pre-diabetics and above 126 you are having diabetics, similarly if you look at the postprandial that means after 2 hours of the meal if you give a blood sample and if the blood sugar value is less than 140 it is totally normal, and if it is more than 200 you can say that person has diabetes.

If you are struggling with diabetes, depression, anxiety or diabetes burnout and want help. My practice is in NYC, and I work with individuals, couples, and families. If you are not in the NYC Metropolitan area, I also provide Skype services. 

What is Diabetes-Focused Psychotherapy (DFP)?
DFP takes a holistic approach, combining traditional talk therapy with diabetes education and diabetes management support. It addresses both the physical and emotional aspects of living life with diabetes while still addressing other non-diabetes related life problems to create a unique holistic approach to helping people with diabetes live a healthier and happier life.

I treat patients with diabetes of all ages‚Äîand their loving families, too. I provide a safe, caring space to discuss your concerns and issues, create tactics to manage your diabetes and emotions. I will help you reinvent life from here on out. 

Your issues might be Cognitive (learning/memory), Emotional (Anxiety, Anger, Sadness, low self-esteem or nagging guilt), or Situational (Family Conflict, Divorce, Peer Relationships). Regardless of your problem, I can help!

Together, we leave your past behind, and move forward positively, productively, and with high hopes.

and and not really the topic of it because I I know other people that can address that topic much better and I'm happy to refer anyone who wants information on that but I want to talk about tactics to take care of yourself when you are dealing with depression and you have type 1 diabetes for people who do struggle with depression and they are type 1 diabetic that can be a time where their self-care really drops and then they're not only struggling with the fact that they can't get out of a funk or they're feeling really overwhelmed and anxious and sad and just burdened but they're also getting down on themselves for not having good care of their diabetes which is something that always needs attention and always needs management no matter how you feel so I came up with just some basic um bare minimum stuff that I don't struggle with depression but I do struggle with anxiety and I did have an eating disorder for a decade and I've had to learn how when I'm really stressed out or I'm having a rough day coping with a health complication I suffer from pretty extreme PCOS so there are there occurrences every year for me that I'm going to a really rough time with hormonal issues and during those times I can suffer from acute depression and just overall fatigue and anxiety and so I have to kind of resort then to my bare minimum plan and this is something that has helped me be able to not completely fall apart when I'm going through a rough time so my bare minimum plan is that um no matter what I test when I wake up I just that's that's a good start right there and I react accordingly I test two hours after I eat something we can call it breakfast you know sometimes no we don't want to eat right as soon as we wake up but eventually we eat something the first meal of the day I would prefer and I normally do test about an hour and a half sometimes even an hour after my meal just because I've got a much more tight schedule when I'm my crazy Ashton normal self hi function a ahsha but I my bare minimum plan is that I test two hours after each meal at that point then I set alarms to remind myself to test every few hours through the rest of the day because when I'm in a really difficult place and I recently went through quite a long drawn-out health crisis of this past year there were days especially after my surgery where I was so out of it and I was just I was very sick and I really couldn't keep track or anything and so I set alarms on my phone to remind myself not only to take medications that I needed to take that were really important for me to take but my Lantis and stuff like that so set alarms on your cell phone so that you can remind yourself to take care of yourself through the day the other thing too is if you're going through a really a longer period of depression or a health crisis in general that's really occupying a lot of your mental space use some sort of calendar or reminder system to keep yourself on track with diabetes supplies ordering and whatnot I don't really know how I would be able to keep track of all the meds and medical supplies that I need if I didn't set up a system in my Google Calendar so you know I I get everything in three month orders for the most part so a while ago I set up a reoccurring reminder system to two weeks before I run out of a medication and it took a little time to set it up in the beginning just because I was like okay when would two weeks before I run out B but it's totally worth it cuz now I've been using this system for the last six years I think but I just I I worked it out on a calendar so that two weeks before I've run out of any of my meds I have a reminder that gets emailed to me that says ordered blah blah blah and then I go to Walgreens calm and I order it sometimes I order it even too early and insurance is like no you can't have it this early and I'm like that's fine I will wait but at least now it's in my brain the order is in there as soon as insurance allows me to get the necessary medication that I need to keep myself alive then it'll be there waiting for me at the pharmacy so you know we shouldn't have to be expecting ourselves to keep track of everything let's use modern technology as much as we can to try to you know keep some of those things organized if you are struggling with some debilitating anxiety or depression I am a big fan of therapy and there are all types of therapy out there and there's all types of techniques that therapists use so if you see a therapist and you don't click just know that not all therapists are alike and not the the techniques that that a therapist uses are going to be different than a technique that another therapist uses for me personally I'm a really big fan of dialectical behavioral therapy DBT for short it's really about actions that a person can use to replace not so useful behaviors or coping mechanisms that we may have been using before so you replace a habit with other habits or you replace negative thinking with different proactive thinking that is the type of therapy that works the best for me in my eating disorder recovery but I also I also use it a lot now almost organically in negotiating with myself of how to manage or accept certain health things that are going on in my life so I'm a big fan of that but there's also a really great type of therapy called well it's the acronym is a CT therapy and there's CBT therapy which I I personally don't find as useful but other people have found it very useful so there's all sorts of different types of ways that therapists can help you and I really want people to not be discouraged if the first therapist that they see isn't the right fit for them the other thing too that I've learned from being in years and years and years of therapy for a variety of reasons is um therapists cannot read our minds and so we have to be ready to be vulnerable when we go into therapy and that is very hard to do at the first appointment so we can't go into our first second or even third appointment working with the stranger and expect them to resolve all of our problems we have to it's like dating yes you have to it's a new relationship that you're starting with someone who has skills who may be able to offer insight to what your struggles are but it takes time and you have to allow yourself to be vulnerable and honest about what you're really struggling with sometimes I know for me especially when I was younger and I was starting in therapy I didn't really know what my root cause was but I knew that I was in pain I knew the people that I was having troubled relationships with but I didn't fully understand what the problems were I just knew that I was in pain and it is okay to say that in therapy I am I'm in pain about this situation I'm deeply upset I don't know how to not be upset about it vocalize what's going on to the best of your ability because the more you share with these healthcare professionals that want to actually you I mean they went into therapy to help others the more information that they have the more they're going to be able to use that information to try to guide you to healing so another thing is that as I said in the beginning of this diabetes and depression is a common occurrence and it's really important for people who are struggling with depression and diabetes to find others who have struggled with the same thing I mean I know for me my life would not be as stable and as good as it is without the help of the GOC and amazing amazing friendships that I have made there I mean I just get shivers from all the love that I feel from some of my friends that are part of the online diabetes community so I really encourage people who are feeling isolated in their diabetes care to to get involved and where diabetes has some information about the do see on our website but I just want to list off a couple places that you can get started the first that I would really encourage you guys to check out is true diabetes which is part of the diabetes hands foundation it is a huge mecca of chats chat rooms and forums and it has all different types of groups it has support for type 2 diabetics as well as I think even just a tional diabetes but also type 1 diabetes obviously it has support groups for the loved ones the people who love a diabetic of any type it's amazing it's a thriving community and it's just it's awesome I've met people through there that have ended up being we are diabetes clients it's a really thriving community another place that people don't talk about as much but it's amazing if you're a woman the diabetes sisters have a lot of information on their website and different ways to connect on their website but they actually have this amazing program called the the pods groups so they if you're interested in starting on yourself you can contact IBD sisters and get set up and they'll actually train you how to run these in-person support groups for women with diabetes in your city and it's an amazing opportunity but there might also be one already happening in your local area so I strongly encourage any women who are struggling with feeling isolated or overwhelmed or depressed in concurrency with their with their diabetes management to check out diabetes sisters it's for all types of women with all types of diabetes and it's an amazing organization they have a lot of ways to connect to other people with diabetes other women the other thing too is that we our diabetes offers online some use community support hangouts we offer them on a monthly basis we're hoping to actually offer them more than once a month soon and there there is a component that a lot of the people that join are either in early or long term recovery from diabetes and a dual diagnosis eating disorder but we do have some people that have not struggled with an eating disorder and they just like us and for the most part it is type ones but type twos are welcome to join and it's another live event where you can talk to other people who live with diabetes and it helps you not feel alone we complain quite a lot on those it's wonderful it's great venting sessions and it is not censored at all so lots of adult topics get brought up in those for someone looking for perhaps a more uncensored place to to share so a couple other things too and this is that if you live with someone whether you have roommates or whatever your living situation is and you're feeling scattered and you're not really participating in the housework or whatever I strongly encourage you to just tell them that you're going through some stuff right now so that there isn't a built-up resentment between you two it can be hard to be vulnerable leave ulnar ball and say I am struggling dealing with my diabetes is really hard and I'm just feeling overwhelmed and I've just gone through some stuff and I'm sorry if I have not been you know pulling my weight so to speak with with participating and being here with you the other thing too is that if grocery stores are really overwhelming and you are having trouble kind of making sure you have food in your environment at home checkout online grocery delivery service it's my new favorite thing it's like the luxury of my life for me I live a very busy life and I I just kind of need the staples here in our house and I really don't see why I need to keep going back to the grocery store every week to get the same stuff so we've been doing online grocery delivery for I think two years now and it's really it's given me back my three hours on the weekend and I think we all know that grocery shopping on the weekend is horrible so that's when everybody goes it's terrible so check it out see if that's available in your area that it really it's just really nice just have your food brought to you obviously you have to pay for it but the delivery fee is usually like five dollars so I wouldn't otally find paying five dollars for that luxury so those are just a couple of things again if you're really struggling with not only perhaps depression and your diabetes but an eating disorder please reach out to to me at we are diabetes you can email me at Asha Brown at we are diabetes org otherwise you can find me on Facebook	High Medical Info

Keith C Ferdinand professor of medicine at the Tulane University School of Medicine in cardiology at the Tulane Heart and Vascular Institute today I'm talking about diabetes and cardiovascular care if you look at persons who have diabetes specifically type 2 diabetes the number one cause of death is not poor control of glucose but actually ischemic heart disease persons with diabetes die more from ischemic heart disease than from any other cause if we look at the control of glucose itself it may have benefits specifically for micro vascular disease that is retinopathy kidney disease and maybe even prefer arterial disease but for macro vascular disease major heart attacks and dying from heart failure this is the most common cause of death for adults with diabetes some of the newer data using for instance the sglt2 inhibitors with emperor egg show that there is a decrease in overall cardiovascular death total mortality and a decrease in hospitalization for heart failure in the same lines with Kanaka flows and in the canvas study there was a 40% decrease in the aggregate of a progression to in stage renal disease renal failure and death therefore the appropriate treatment of persons with type 2 diabetes is more than just simply controlling glucose in fact some of the studies now suggest that there will be a worldwide epidemic of diabetes as many as 400 million people across the globe by 2025 there will not be enough endocrinologist to actually control this particular condition unfortunately racial and ethnic minorities are often underrepresented in clinical outcomes trials therefore I led an initiative to have a study done in a high-risk population who had both hypertension and type 2 diabetes african-americans in this particular study with 150 persons who had uncontrolled diabetes with a hemoglobin of a1c from eleven and uncontrolled hypertension with systolic blood pressure of 140 to 180 we enrolled patients and randomized them to either placebo or implica folding starting at 10 milligrams and increasing to 25 milligrams the patients then had ambulatory blood pressure monitoring done because implica frozen is an anti diabetic medicine the primary outcome was 24 weeks decrease in hemoglobin a1c which was met from a baseline hemoglobin a1c of approximately 8.5 with the decrease of 0.78 nevertheless they were pre-specified incomes nevertheless there were pre-specified outcomes specifically related to blood pressure using ambulatory blood pressure mounting which is a valid way of measuring the effects of blood pressure for any medication we saw a statistically significant decrease of approximately six millimeters in the systolic blood pressure on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring at 12 weeks which was maintained for 24 weeks the clinic blood pressure was decreased approximately four millimeters of mercury this was not statistically significant but clinically meaningful even more importantly after 24 weeks the clinic blood pressure also decreased statistically there was also a loss in body weight with implica Folsom therefore the sglt2 s may be beneficial in african-american patients who have both hypertension and diabetes while not a cardiovascular outcomes trial our abstract published in Jax suggested that there may be a real benefit in blood pressure reduction and control of glucose with the bonus of some degree of weight loss using implica Folsom and sglt2 inhibitors in african-americans who had both hypertension and type-2 diabetes this is an important study despite its small sample size and the fact that there were no cardiovascular outcomes it suggested implica Folsom can be used safely in this population african-americans are known to have an increase in hypertension and coma diabetes and in fact 80% of persons who have type 2 diabetes also have hypertension and this is even higher in the black population in the regard study a large southern cohort of over 30,000 persons only 30 percent of african-americans who had both diabetes and hypertension had their blood pressures controlled to less than 130 over 80 implica Fulton has been shown to be beneficial in the Emporer egg study nevertheless in the study which we just completed control of cardiovascular risks specifically diabetes glucose and blood pressure can be used in this particular population I'm dr.

medicine today we are going to be looking at impaired fasting glucose versus impaired glucose tolerance we want to understand what they mean and what we should expect so for impaired fasting glucose that's ifg simply if you check the fasting blood sugar of a patient and it is greater than or equal to 6.1 millimoles per liter but less than 7.0 millimoles per liter it falls in the zone of an impaired fasting glucose and if that is the case always make sure to do an oral glucose tolerance test to exclude diabetes mellitus for the impaired glucose tolerance what are we looking at fasting blood sugar is less than 7.0 millimoles per liter and the oral glucose glucosaurus test has two hour glucose synonymous with random blood sugar is greater than or equal to 7.8 millimoles per liter and less than 11.1 millimoles per liter if it is like that then we will see that is an impaired glucose tolerance bear in mind that in such a scenario you can have both impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance at the same time at the end of the lesson we're looking at some examples to clarify that we should also know that both impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance they are a window for lifestyle modification and they connect to a pre-diabetes state so if you fall if your blood sugar falls within that range you are looking at pre-diabetes it means during that window lifestyle modifications such as diets weight loss exercise would be very important in advertising a progression to diabetes mellitus and you should also know that impaired fasting glucose progressed lower to diabetes mellitus than impaired glucose tolerance in other ways impaired glucose tolerance is more dangerous than impaired fasting glucose now let's look at some examples so the first example fasting blood sugar 6.8 millimoles per liter random blood sugar 7.2 millimoles per liter what is your impression is it going to be an impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance you have five seconds to get the answer i believe you've gotten your answer ready so for this if you watch very carefully the fasting blood sugar is 6.8 let's roll back here we said if the fasting blood sugar is greater than or equal to 6.1 and less than 7.0 then it falls in the range of impaired fasting glucose what do we have here 6.8 does it fall within that range yes it means we have an impaired fasting glucose what of the random blood sugar 7.2 look up here does it fall within this range does it fall within the range for the impaired glucose tolerance no definitely is lesser than the 7.8 landmark meaning that there's no impaired glucose tolerance but there's an impaired fasting glucose i believe you got that now the second example fasting blood sugar 5.8 millimoles per liter random blood sugar 8.1 millimoles per liter you have a few seconds to get your answer so for this i believe you've gotten your answer ready now let's look at the answer fasting blood sugar 5.8 millimoles per liter if you look at the criteria for impaired fasting glucose you will realize that the 5.8 is lower than a 6.1 meaning it's not in that range meaning that there is no impaired fasting glucose now let's move ahead and look at the impaired glucose tolerance for impaired glucose tolerance what do we need we need a blood sugar that's a random blood sugar or ogt to our glucose to be greater than 9.7.8 and less than 11.1 what do we have here 8.1 8.1 yes it falls within this category meaning that there's impaired glucose tolerance so our answer is what impaired glucose tolerance i hope you got that now then this and the last example fasting blood sugar 6.7 millimost per liter and random blood sugar that's ogtt to our glucose 9.8 millimoles per liter you have few seconds to provide your answer let's look at the solution for that question if you look at the fasting blush you guys look at 6.7 millimoles per liter if you look at the criteria for impaired fasting glucose you realize that the 6.7 falls within that criteria meaning that there's what an impaired fasting glucose let's move to weather the random blood sugar falls within the criteria for impaired glucose tolerance for the impaired glucose tolerance yes fasting blood sugar should be less than six seven millimoles per liter is that true yes definitely it's true random blood sugar that's the ogtt two our glucose it should be greater than record 7.8 and less than 11.1 what do we have here 9.8 does it fall here yes meaning that there is also impaired glucose 11. so in that case our answer will be impaired fasting glucose and what impaired glucose tolerance i believe we've gotten the understanding of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance if so kindly subscribe to my channel

long¬†list of low glycemic foods that do not spike blood¬†¬† sugar these foods are blood sugar friendly and¬†favorable for anyone with diabetes and insulin¬†¬† resistance but also for everyone really because¬†having stable blood sugar has both short-term¬†¬† and long-term benefits short-term benefits¬†include consistent energy throughout the day¬†¬† less cravings and clearer thinking long-term¬†benefits include prevention of conditions such¬†¬† as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes reducing¬†your risk of heart disease and reducing your¬†¬† risk of other diseases as well having a general¬†understanding of the impact the different foods¬†¬† have on our blood sugar will set you up for a¬†long healthy life so in today's video i'm going¬†¬† to be giving you over 75 foods that are low on¬†the glycemic index and do not spike blood sugar hey guys welcome back to my channel if you're new¬†here my name is kait i'm a health coach and i post¬†¬† videos on a high fat nutrient dense way of eating¬†if you like this video please give it a thumbs up¬†¬† feel free to share and make sure to subscribe and¬†make sure to follow me on instagram twitter and¬†¬† facebook where's your new posts every single day¬†we're going to start off today quickly recapping¬†¬† what blood sugar is and why it matters for our¬†health and then we will get into the list but¬†¬† if you're a bit impatient and want to skip ahead¬†i always have time stamps on the progress bar just¬†¬† below if you hover your mouse over top of that¬†you can see the different time stamps and you can¬†¬† click ahead to the list but i really encourage¬†you not to skip ahead because what we're going¬†¬† to be talking about first just having this basic¬†understanding can make such a difference for your¬†¬† health what is blood sugar blood sugar also¬†known as blood glucose is the concentration¬†¬† of sugar that is in your blood at any point in¬†time your body requires roughly 4 grams of sugar¬†¬† to be circulating your bloodstream however when we¬†eat certain foods these foods are broken down into¬†¬† glucose and released in the bloodstream which¬†causes our blood sugar to rise in response to¬†¬† this rise in blood sugar your pancreas releases¬†insulin which shuttles the sugar out of the blood¬†¬† and to your cells to be used for energy¬†and as the excess sugar leaves your blood¬†¬† your blood sugar levels return back to baseline¬†your body always wants to maintain homeostasis and¬†¬† keep your blood sugar at this baseline when your¬†blood sugar is too high this can lead to problems¬†¬† and same goes for when it is too low right in¬†the middle at about 4 grams is the sweet spot¬†¬† measuring your blood sugar is easy all you need¬†is a small device called the blood glucose monitor¬†¬† which you can buy at pharmacies or¬†online from companies such as keto mojo¬†¬† you prick your finger with a small needle to draw¬†blood and put the blood on a sensor strip and¬†¬† within a couple of seconds you'll have a current¬†reading of the amount of sugar that's in your¬†¬† blood glycemic variability glycemic variability¬†refers to the changes in blood sugar that happen¬†¬† over a period of time someone with high glycemic¬†variability will see a wide variance in their¬†¬† blood sugar levels throughout the day there will¬†be large swings up and down in their blood glucose¬†¬† after eating for example and someone with low¬†glycemic variability will have very little¬†¬† variance in their blood sugar throughout the day¬†their line will be more or less flat now here's¬†¬† the thing the body is very resilient and it can¬†handle these large influxes in blood sugar when¬†¬† they happen however if you are having these large¬†spikes and dips constantly throughout the day day¬†¬† after day this is when it can lead to problems¬†doing this will cause your cells to become less¬†¬† sensitive to insulin and remember that insulin is¬†the hormone that transports excess sugar from your¬†¬† bloodstream and into your cells so when your cells¬†start resisting insulin they're not taking in¬†¬† blood sugar as they should your muscle cells are¬†the first to become resistant to insulin meaning¬†¬† that excess glucose is now more likely to be¬†stored as fat and this is of course a side effect¬†¬† of insulin resistance that people are absolutely¬†not thrilled about and on top of that insulin¬†¬† resistance will eventually lead to high fasting¬†blood sugar and a type 2 diabetes diagnosis¬†¬† it can also manifest as other diseases such¬†as pcos and heart disease furthermore there's¬†¬† a lot of evidence that people with high glycemic¬†variability are at a greater risk of hypoglycemia¬†¬† which is when your blood sugar drops too¬†low i did a whole video on hypoglycemia¬†¬† if you guys are curious maybe you experience it¬†and you want to know more about how it is related¬†¬† to glycemic variability and insulin resistance i¬†will link that video up above but basically the¬†¬† lower our glycemic variability the more stable¬†we can keep our blood sugar throughout the day¬†¬† the better not only for the prevention of¬†diseases which i just discussed but for¬†¬† short-term benefits as well with stable blood¬†sugar and low glycemic variability your energy¬†¬† will be steady throughout the day you won't have¬†energy crashes mid-morning or mid-afternoon where¬†¬† you lose focus and are craving a snack you will¬†be able to think clearer and have less brain fog¬†¬† you will sleep better and your hormones will¬†remain in balance and these are just a few¬†¬† of the short-term benefits you might experience¬†anyways enough chit chat let's get into the list¬†¬† protein sources quality protein sources that do¬†not contain carbohydrates are very blood sugar¬†¬† friendly these include anchovies bass beef bison¬†cod chicken crab deer duck herring kangaroo yes¬†¬† i live in australia and yes we eat kangaroo¬†lamb lobster mackerel oysters salmon sardines¬†¬† shrimp trout tuna turkey pork and rabbit now in¬†terms of vegetarian protein sources i will give¬†¬† a couple examples of these as well but for those¬†of you who have been around my channel for a while¬†¬† i'm sure you're aware i am a big advocate¬†for quality animal protein the main reason is¬†¬† blood sugar control plant protein sources come¬†with more carbohydrates which impact our blood¬†¬† sugar and also less protein per calorie so¬†you're getting less bang for your buck from¬†¬† a nutrition standpoint animal protein is superior¬†hands down but i do understand that some people¬†¬† have their reasons for wanting to limit or exclude¬†animal products from their diet so here are some¬†¬† top picks of vegetarian protein sources that won't¬†spike your blood sugar almonds brazil nuts various¬†¬† cheeses such as cottage cheese cheddar mozzarella¬†swiss and parmesan eggs hazelnuts hemp seeds¬†¬† macadamia nuts walnuts and full fat yogurt beans¬†and legumes can potentially be all right as well¬†¬† but i say that hesitantly because they come¬†with a laundry list of other side effects¬†¬† the least of which being gas and the worst¬†of which being autoimmune symptoms vegetables¬†¬† in terms of vegetables anything that is low sugar¬†and non-starchy is going to be low glycemic and¬†¬† blood sugar friendly artichoke asparagus¬†broccoli brussels sprouts butternut squash¬†¬† cabbage cauliflower celery cucumber eggplant¬†garlic green bell pepper lettuce mushrooms onions¬†¬† pickles spaghetti squash and zucchini fruit when¬†it comes to fruit you mainly want to stay away¬†¬† from tropical fruit which are very high in sugar¬†and spike blood sugar significantly good ones to¬†¬† include are avocado blackberries blueberries¬†coconut olives kiwi lemons limes raspberries¬†¬† peaches strawberries and tomatoes fats and oils¬†and let's finish off with some healthy fats and¬†¬† oils now technically anything that is mainly fat¬†is going to be very blood sugar friendly however¬†¬† some types of fat are definitely healthier than¬†others when it comes to cooking oils and fats¬†¬† those that are solid at room temperature are¬†best as they are able to withstand the most¬†¬† heat and if you weren't expecting me to say¬†that and that caught you totally off guard¬†¬† check out this video after about good and bad¬†fats why there is a misconception that saturated¬†¬† fat is unhealthy and why oils like vegetable oil¬†are worse for your health for today's purposes¬†¬† i will just say the vegetable oils which include¬†canola soybean grape seed corn and safflower¬†¬† anything that's high in polyunsaturated¬†fat and comes from a seed basically¬†¬† these actually contribute to insulin resistance¬†and should be avoided as much as possible¬†¬† healthy fats and oils you should include are¬†avocado oil bacon grease beef tallow butter¬†¬† chicken fat coconut oil cod liver oil duck fat¬†flaxseed oil ghee mct oil and olive oil anyways¬†¬† guys that's all i have for you today let me know¬†in the comment section down below which of these¬†¬† blood sugar friendly foods is your favorite maybe¬†also let me know which one is your least favorite¬†¬† just

cSJxstCVITY	UCPyMN8DzkFl2__xnTEiGZ1w	27.0	Peripheral Arterial Disease vs Peripheral Venous Disease (PAD and PVD) Nursing Symptoms	"This review will compare peripheral arterial disease vs peripheral venous disease. This is a nursing review for nursing students and nurses.

Peripheral arterial and venous diseases are two types of peripheral vascular disease (PVD). PAD occurs when there is disease of the peripheral arteries, and it mainly affects the lower extremities. Therefore, there is an issue with blood flow going to the extremities and ischemia occurs.

Peripheral venous disease occurs when there is disease of the peripheral veins, and it mainly affects the lower extremities. Therefore, there is an issue with blood flow leaving the extremities and going back to the heart. 

This review will discuss the differences between the signs and symptoms of arterial and venous disease.

F for dangling the legs or putting them in the dependent position they will be ruber which means they will become red and warm from the inflammation of those arteries it's getting blood flow that when you elevate those legs that's going to impede blood flow so the legs will be compel with Venus disease there's not an issue with perfusion that blood can get just fine to those lower extremities the problem is it can't leave those lower extremities and drain back to the heart so the extremities will be warm to the touch they will actually because you have so much pulling of the blood you don't have the clearance of that cellular waste the skin is going to be thick and tough it's also going to be swollen from edema and it can have a brownish color to it as you can see here in this picture the next s is for strength of the pulse in the lower extremity for arterial because circulation is compromised to that extremity it's going to be very poor and in severe cases it can be absent whenever you're checking pulses in a patient with PA d you can palpate but you want to use a Doppler device as well so you can actually hear it and grade it accordingly with venous disease we don't have a problem with blood getting there to the extremity so the pulse will be present and it's typically normal efore edema is it present with arterial no it's not common they will not have swelling with venous it's very common and the swelling tends to be worse at the end of the day and that's because we don't have that blood being able to return back to the heart and lastly l4 lesion specifically ulcers and ask the nurse you want to know about where these are going to be located and how they look because they're different so for our Terrier ulcers they're going to be located on the ends of the toes the dorsum of the feet which is the top of the feet or the lateral malleolus which is the lateral ankle region that's where you're going to find these ulcers their appearance is that they're gonna have little drainage remember blood flow is compromised to these ulcers so they're not gonna drain a lot and they're not going to have tissue granulation meaning new whoo healing so they're gonna be Pell and very lot pink or they can even be necrotic and black another thing is that they're unique and how they look because they're deep and they look like literally someone has punched out the skin and that's a term that is used law a punched out appearance with noticeable margins and edges and they'll have this deep round area and here in this picture here you can see an example of an arterial ulcer it is found on the lateral malleolus notice it has that punched out look it's nice and round it's deep it's Pell on the inside and that skin is even scaly and dry around it however with venous ulcers also called venous stasis ulcers they tend to be located on the medial parts of the lower legs and the medial malleolus area so that medial part of the ankle the ulcers tend to appear swollen the skin will be tied around them there'll be a Dima and there will be drainage along with granulation present because remember we don't have a blood flow issue blood flows getting there just fine we have a problem with it returning back so the base of the wound will be pink to a deep red and the edges will be irregular they're not gonna be nice and round and the depth of the wound tends to be shallow and here you can see an example of a venous stasis ulcer it's found on that medial part of the lower leg and the medial malleolus area and notice the skin is very tight around it swollen in the base of the wound is that deep red and it's very irregular in shallow okay so that wraps up this review over arterial versus venous disease	High Medical Info

You‚Äôll need: ‚Ä¢ Your bottle of insulin‚Ä¢ Syringe ‚Ä¢ And a sharps container Always wash your hands with soap and waterbefore you begin. Typically, there are 3 syringe sizes:‚Ä¢ 1 cc holds 100 units of insulin ‚Ä¢ a ¬Ω cc holds 50 units‚Ä¢ and 1/3 cc holds 30 units Talk to your care team about how much insulinyou need and which syringe size you should use. Insulin needles have gotten much smaller overthe years. So they are much less painful than you might expect. When you first get your insulin, keep it refrigerated.After the first time you use it, you can keep it in room temperature for 28 to 42 days.It will more comfortable to inject. If you have cloudy insulin, it needs to bemixed. Gently roll the bottle in your hands. Then rotate it from top to bottom, withoutshaking. ‚Ä¢ When you‚Äôre ready to inject, pull theplunger back to the number of units needed, drawing air into the syringe.‚Ä¢ Insert the needle into the bottle of the insulin through the rubber cap.‚Ä¢ Inject the air from the syringe into the bottle.‚Ä¢ Turn the bottle upside down with the needle in it.‚Ä¢ Make sure the tip of the needle is fully submerged in the insulin as you pull the plungerback to the correct number of insulin units. This helps prevent air bubbles. Air bubbles aren‚Äôt harmful, but can takeup room and prevent you from getting the right dose. If you have bubbles, simply inject the contentsback into the bottle and repeat the procedure. Next, inject at a 90-degree angle. Hold for 5 seconds. Then pull the needle out. Drop the syringe into the sharps container,which you can buy at any local pharmacy. Ask your diabetes care manager where to safelydispose of your sharps container when it‚Äôs full. Make sure not to re-use insulin needles, asit‚Äôs not safe and can cause more pain with injection. It‚Äôs important to switch injection sitesto prevent bruising and pain. Each time you inject, choose a new site thisway: ‚Ä¢ Rotate injection sites in a imaginarycircle. ‚Ä¢ Always leave 2 fingers width in betweeninjection sites. ‚Ä¢ And, keep the same distance from yourbelly button. Your care team prescribes insulin becauseit‚Äôs safe and effective. We‚Äôre confident you will be able to use it successfully. Ifyou have any questions about how to inject insulin, or how much to take, ask your caremanager. Adjusting to a new habit can be challengingat first, but the benefits to your health are worth it.

ten nights before this I woke up extremely thirsty and tired but without a care in the world and that night when I went to bed I had diabetes I of course didn't know that I had diabetes but a couple nights after this I realized that I had gone to the bathroom at least three times in the past hour and I looked around my room and there were empty water bottles all over the place and this is when I realized that I had gotten up in the middle of the night to drink from my sink because I had ran out of water and all of a sudden I felt really sick so I ran upstairs and told my mom what was going on my mom also has type 1 diabetes so she know she knew what was happening immediately she said I could go to the doctors the next day and nothing was wrong the next day I was ecstatic about missing school but when I got there they had me urinate in a plastic cup and I thought excuse me I'm only here because I have a cold a little while later the doctor came into our room she placed her hands on my knees and told me that I was a strong and beautiful and capable of anything and that I had type 1 diabetes at the time all I knew about diabetes was that you have to test your blood and give yourself shots every day so I was freaking out and so many questions were running through my head but I realized that she was still talking she said that the hospital was expecting me in about an hour and I had time to go home and get anything I needed my mom didn't tell me that I had diabetes that night because she wanted me to have my last night of freedom free from the stress of t1d and as I was walking out of the doctor's office all I was thinking about was how I needed my little sister so I was quiet the whole drive until we picked her up she got in the car and I explained what had happened and that she was the first person that I wanted to tell she was only eight years old so she was a little confused and she was looking back and forth in between my mom and I and then she started to giggle and this made me laugh and I didn't feel like she was laughing at me and the fact that I had diabetes but I felt like she was laughing just to laugh I got home I packed my things and I left I was walking into the hospital when my mom said that my best friend was on the phone she asked me where I was why wasn't at school if I was okay and if anything had happened I told her that I was walking into the hospital after a couple seconds of silence she whispers oh shoot did you break your leg I giggled a little took a deep breath and told her that I had just been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes then there was just silence and after that muffled crying and this made me so nervous but I realized that I couldn't be afraid of who I was and when I got back from the hospital I started to have a complete meltdown and I decided that I wasn't going to have anything to do with diabetes I wasn't going to dose and I wasn't going to care but I quickly realized that this was not the best solution and it was hurting me way more than it was helping my mom came over and told me that if she could she would take diabetes from me and she sat me down and told me that everyone has something and this is my something and it's true everyone has something but on Monday I had my parents drive me to school because I didn't want to see my friends on the bus and I didn't want any attention drawn to me when I got to school I buried my face in my coat and ran up the stairs to my locker I noticed that there were an odd number of people surrounding the area but I figured it was someone's birthday as I got closer I noticed that all of those people were surrounding my locker and I went completely red I found out that my friends had gone to school early to decorate my locker and they had went out and bought all sorts of gifts to and people I didn't even know had written me letters explaining how I could I was capable of anything and this is when this is again when I figured out that I couldn't be afraid of who I was and I had to embrace it but it's been hard and I've tried really hard to stay open and positive about diabetes but people just don't understand the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes which are totally different things and I was made fun of a lot because of it and I've had to explain to tons of people that I'm the same person and I can do the exact same things that they can and they just don't understand but my sister said that they're always going to be people like that in the world and you either have to push past them or push them down and if I hadn't have gotten diabetes I wouldn't have been able to meet my best friend who also has t1d and don't get me wrong diabetes is awful but I've had the opportunity to do amazing things because of it and for example over this past summer I was chosen along with two other kids to represent the state of Utah in Washington DC I got to speak with Senator hatch and asked him to renew the special diabetes program which is a fund of 150 million dollars given by the government per year for diabetes research I've told my story to Rotary Clubs local news stations and other students and about a year ago my friends and I convinced the Park City School District to hire more school nurses and I started a rental photobooth company with my younger siblings and we donate 15% of our profit two JDRF I have a goal to raise 1 million dollars before my little brother graduates from high school I'm working on it with the CEO of JDRF and my family currently there's no cure for t1d but type 1 has taught me to be more empathetic of those who are different it's taught me to stand up for myself to run a business to speak in public and to stand up for others but more importantly it's taught me to try harder to find a cure inhale the future and exhale the past I'm capable of amazing things and so are you thank you [Applause]	Low Medical Info

Transcript:

Geriatricians face a lot of challenges when providing diabetes care, and the challenges really stem from the fact that most older adults don't just have diabetes. They're likely to have hypertension, many of them may have chronic renal disease, but they also may have things that aren't directly related to their diabetes, such as osteoarthritis, chronic pain from other problems. 

I think the biggest challenges are really about setting priorities and making sure that you keep things as simple as you can, but at the same time, making sure that you're offering the therapies that reduce morbidity and lengthen life and improve quality of life for patients. 

Another big challenge with caring for older adults with diabetes is that it is a very heterogeneous population. Now when you think about it, if somebody is 68 or 69, they could be a person who's had type 2 diabetes for 30 years, and it could be well controlled. But you can also have somebody at the same age who may have already had a stroke, who may have found out a year ago that they have type 2 diabetes. So, we can't just go with age. We have to really think about life expectancy. We have to think about what are the other chronic conditions that the person has under treatment. We also have to think about their functional status, and we have to think a lot about their cognitive status and family support. 

We know that older adults with type 2 diabetes are much more likely to get a group of conditions that we call the geriatric syndromes than people who are of a similar age and don't have diabetes.  

These geriatric syndromes include gait problems and falls, cognitive impairment, higher rates of depression, higher rates of chronic pain, urinary continence, and challenges with what we call polypharmacy.  

Medicare beneficiaries, oftentimes people over 65, will be on six or more prescription drugs. And when you think about how hard it is to just take one antibiotic correctly when you get sick, you can imagine what it must be like to try to take all of these pills correctly every day.  

The probability of drug-drug interactions, creating yet a third symptom, happens quite frequently. And as medical regimens get more complex and more medications are added, adherence goes down. 

So, in addition to taking care of the diabetes, these conditions really need to be screened for because many of them are treatable.  

And I have to mention that particularly depression travels a lot with diabetes, and we have a growing evidence base that, if you don't treat the depression, it's very hard, not only for older adults but for all adults, to take care of their diabetes. 

You really have to take a very holistic approach to the person you're treating and, as much as possible, you need to engage them in shared decision-making. So, with patients with type 2 diabetes who are older, the frail ones and the people with impaired cognition, there are a lot of family meetings in these decision-making sessions. And we really, as a group, have to decide what's going to be the most feasible and practical care plan to keep someone's quality of life as high as possible, for as long as possible, and to keep the burden of our treatments as low as possible. 

The Guiding Principles have a lot of very useful information for taking care of older adults. And the document that came out of this process has 10 guiding principles.  

They're very practical. And for all of us who care for older adults with type 2 diabetes, it provides a very efficient place to find that information. So, I would encourage you to look at it and incorporate some of the suggestions into your practice. I think you'll find it helpful."	16800.0	PT4M43S	2d	hd	True		0.0			10274.0	101.0	0.0	10.0	2013-07-11T19:50:18Z	National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)	3762574.0	DR.

Luckily I'm ok! I hope that by sharing my story, I can raise awareness about the seriousness and unpredictability of T1D, but also show others living with diabetes that we are strong and can overcome moments like these. Have you ever had an experience like this?	35100.0	PT11M50S	2d	hd	False		0.0			12755.0	549.0	0.0	216.0	2006-08-10T02:53:21Z	Michelle Lord	2475249.0	okay i'm just gonna take a deep breath before i start this because i just had a low and lows make me really really anxious lately and you will know why once you watch this video i am sitting down to share with you what happened this weekend some of you who follow me on instagram probably saw the story i took a lovely ambulance ride to the er because of low blood sugar so that's a first for me i have never had to go to the hospital for low blood sugar in 20 years of having type 1 diabetes first time for everything i'm not filming this video to scare anyone i don't want to scare anyone but i just want to share my story kind of let you know what happened make you aware that this kind of thing can happen you know type 1 diabetes is a very wild disease to have very unpredictable and you can do everything you can to keep yourself under control but sometimes things happen but i also want to show that i'm totally fine um i got through what happened and i'm here physically okay mentally not so much but i will get there i actually did kind of record this more live time or directly after this happened on instagram so how this video is gonna work is i'm gonna insert those stories into this video and then i'm just gonna elaborate after that because i feel like the story is best told from my instagram story because i did film it right after it happened so everything was kind of fresh in my mind so i am going to insert that right here hey everyone i hope you are having a good saturday much better than the saturday i've had um i was in the emergency room this afternoon with some very scary low blood sugars never had to go in before for lows and this was definitely the scariest diabetes incident that i've had in all 20 years of living with hype on diabetes so i just wanted to come on here share my experience and see if anyone else has had the same thing happen because we're still looking for answers um to explain what i just went through today so pretty much day started off normal i had breakfast and then my pump was running out of insulin but i had just changed my sight recently so i just changed the cartridge and that's it um about half hour after i changed the cartridge and everything was set up i started going low really really fast and i even thought wow this is a really aggressive low so treated it like normal went up a little bit and then i noticed i was dropping in like very fast like double arrow down and we had these fruit juice pops i was just like chugging these juices and it would go up a bit and then just drop and it kept going down to like the low two so like 2.3 2.4 2.5 it was very scary i felt like i was losing control so within an hour and a half time period i went low five times very aggressive drops where i i thought i was coming up and then it would just be like double arrow down all of a sudden and i tested with my glucometer many times my dexcom was accurate and i just felt like i couldn't get rid of these lows it was so aggressive it was like i'd given myself a ton of insulin even though i hadn't so we were getting really scared i was actually eating honey out of a jar with a spoon it was insane we estimated that i had about 300 grams of carbohydrates my pump had been disconnected for over two hours and just nothing nothing i kept going low so i was not feeling well i was really scared rafi my husband decided to call an ambulance um luckily like i didn't pass out or at anything i didn't need actual help but i just didn't know what's going on with my body and we felt like i needed to go get checked out so he called an ambulance they took me to the er i was there all afternoon they ran a ton of tests on me and of course my blood sugar was high all afternoon because of the 300 grams of carbs i ingested so nothing is wrong internally that they could find the er doc said that she thought it was my pump that it was giving me more insulin than it should um and i was on the phone with tandem when i got home and we did a lot of tests to see and everything looks okay with my pup so it's really a mystery the rep did suggest though that since i changed my cartridge on its own without changing the site that it could have caused some sort of weird pressure gradient and i maybe got some extra insulin because i did that but honestly like i have a physics degree my husband has a physics degree we understand pressure gradients we don't really get how that could have happened so it is really confusing and we're still like thinking about what happened i'm kind of scared being connected to my pump right now to be honest because i'm worried it's broken but so far so good i'm hoping for an uneventful evening just one last thing i want to mention is that i am weaning off breastfeeding right now so my milk supply has drastically decreased i'm wondering if there could be a big hormonal change a big hormonal shift that could have caused these low blood sugars although i doubt it just given how aggressive they were i feel like it came from insulin good morning everyone i just wanted to come on here and say hi i am doing okay this morning and thank you so much for all of your kind messages i received hundreds of messages yesterday from people just supportive messages and also people telling me similar experiences that they've had and those have been really helpful to read haven't gotten through all of them yet let alone had a chance to respond but just wanted to say thank you i see the messages coming in and i'm very grateful just an update for what's happening this morning um i'm okay i honestly am just really on edge and anxious my husband and i did a lot of chatting last night and this morning trying to figure out what happened and what was the cause of this really scary incident i had yesterday with the lows and we really we strongly feel that it was from me receiving a large amount of insulin and that it was not hormonal just given the time period it happened in given the series of events um the severity of the lows also what the doctor said in the er i really think i received a large amount of insulin although obviously i can't say whether or not that's 100 true this is just my gut feeling and because of that i am really scared and feel unsafe to have my current insulin pump on i'm scared to bolus with it today for breakfast i actually bolst using a syringe instead of the insulin pump because i don't i'm not 100 confident that i'm getting the right amount of insulin from my pump so i did call tandem diabetes this morning and told them what was going on and said that i feel unsafe wearing my current pump and i requested a replacement pump under my warranty so the individual i talked to on the phone was super nice they're always so so good to deal with there at tandem diabetes but she wasn't able to issue me a replacement pump on the spot she had to escalate this to someone else and i'm still waiting to hear back so fingers crossed that i hear back sometime soon so that we can get this replacement pump on the way because yeah i definitely feel very uncomfortable wearing my current pump and i would feel much better having a new one just knowing it's like a fresh pump with no potential issues but i will keep you updated with what happens and i just want to say thank you again for all the support hey everyone look what just came to my door so quick i'm honestly shocked at how fast um they shipped me a new insulin pump it came in like two hours um after i talked to the rep so all is well i'm feeling much better much more comforted knowing that i have this there still is no evidence that it was my insulin pump but i'm going to be sending my old insulin pump back so that they can do a very thorough check but thank you so much to tandem for helping me out with this so there you go that is what happened definitely the scariest thing that i've ever had happen to me with type 1 diabetes i can't quite explain how scary it was i feel like that story didn't even capture the fear that i had well this was all happening but i have my new pump on or the replacement pump and i definitely feel more at ease we still have no idea what caused this like it might not have even been the pump like we have no idea but tandem was really really good dealing with it and they took my pump back so i shipped it back to them and they are going to do a very thorough examination of it just to make sure that nothing happened with the pump there are a few other possibilities that might have caused this i just wanted to kind of bring up in this video in case some of you are curious so i did post this story to instagram and i honestly got almost 500 responses from you all which is insane i couldn't believe it so many people have experienced things like this situations like this with lows that no matter what you ate you just couldn't bring up very very scary situations someone even told me that this happened to them on an airplane can't imagine that is just terrifying a few of you mentioned zombie sites which i thought was really interesting never really crossed my mind but apparently what can happen is if your insulin pump site is in some scar tissue you can have insulin build up there and then it will just release all of a sudden into your body so you'll just get this surge of insulin um and someone suggested maybe that's what happened to me i don't think this is what happened to me because i feel like if i had one of those zombie sites my blood sugar would have been stubborn beforehand and running high before the low incident and it wasn't it was pretty normal so i feel like that's not what happened but definitely good to be aware of another thing that a lot of people messaged me about was was i connected to the tubing when i was priming no i was not connected to the tubing although i can see how if you're kind of in a rush and not thinking yeah maybe that could happen but no that did not happen some other people mentioned hormones as well you can see in from my story i also was kind of thinking hormones but just given how severe the whole episode was and it was just for like a three hour chunk of time and then after i went back to normal i don't think it was hormones and if anything when you're weaning off breastfeeding i feel like your blood sugars would be going high rather than low so yes it is still a mystery we still have no idea we may never know what happened and i feel like that's quite often the conclusion of diabetes incidents for me over the past 20 years if i have an incident where i have ketones or have gone high there's not always an answer and unfortunately that is just type 1 diabetes there is not always an answer you kind of just have to accept that it happened deal with it in the moment and move on from it and just try to go back to your life even though it can be hard after an incident like this to go back to your life not gonna lie to you i have been running high because i am scared to go low obviously this is not a good habit you do not want to run that high all the time but i'm trying to just slowly bring my target range back down until i feel more comfortable i did go through a traumatic experience i don't know if that's being dramatic but i feel like it was a traumatic experience so yes that is my scariest diabetes experience i can't believe it happened 20 years after i was diagnosed like just such a wild disease but thank you for watching let me know in the comments below if you have ever experienced anything like this love to hear your stories and i hope you are all doing well thanks so much for tuning in bye	Low Medical Info

Hey all, this weeks video is a thorough guide on how to test your blood sugar levels properly. I've also included some really useful tips which I believe everyone should know.  

Let me know how you get on with my guide by leaving a comment below. If you have any friends or family who would also benefit from this video then feel free to spread the word. Thanks for watching.

BLOOD GLUCOSE TESTING:
Blood glucose testing, also known as blood glucose monitoring, is one of the main tools involved in controlling diabetes.

Not everyone with diabetes will test their blood glucose levels but it is regarded as being very beneficial for helping to make diet and medication dosing decisions.

If you are on any medication that can lead to hypoglycaemia (most notably insulin), you should test your blood glucose levels.

WHAT IS A LANCING DEVICE:
Lancing devices are used to obtain samples of blood for glucose testing using a lancet.

A variety of lancets are on the market, the most common of which are automatic lancing devices (Used in the video).

TESTING BLOOD GLUCOSE METER & TESTS STRIPS:
Control solutions are used to check that the meter and test strips are working together properly and that the test is performing correctly. Most control solutions last 90 days after opening, please check yours for the actual date. The acceptable range of glucose for that solution is listed on the back of your test strip vial or control solution.

USEFUL TIPS:
Please watch the full video for all of them but here are some important ones,
‚Ä¢ Use a new lancet every time you use your lancing device. I know it's time consuming but if you don't change, it's going to hurt more and you're at risk of a skin infection.
‚Ä¢ Diabetic patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over time. It‚Äôs really important that you only ever use one meter to build up a trend of results because different meters will give slightly different results.

HOW TO TEST BLOOD GLUCOSE:
‚Ä¢ Prepare your kit for testing.
‚Ä¢ This should include: your meter, test strip, lancing device, cotton wool, monitoring diary and sharps bin.
‚Ä¢ Ensure that the lancing device is primed with a new lancet.
‚Ä¢ Wash and dry your hands - to ensure that the result is not influenced by any sugars that may be present on your fingers.
‚Ä¢ A fuller drop of blood will be obtained if your fingers are warm, so it‚Äôs worth warming your hands by washing with warm water and rubbing them for 10 seconds.
‚Ä¢ Put a test strip into your meter, make sure it switches on and is ready.
‚Ä¢ Prick your finger with the lancing device at the sides of the finger as there are less nerve ending here than at the tips or the ‚Äòpads‚Äô. Switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skin. You may want to avoid using your little finger due to the skin being thin.
‚Ä¢ If your hands are warmed up you shouldn't need to squeeze your finger for a blood drop, if necessary apply light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Squeezing too hard can interfere with results.
‚Ä¢ Wipe away the first blood drop with clean cotton wool and use the second blood drop for testing (careful not to smear the drop).
‚Ä¢ Gently touch the blood drop with the test strip in the meter, wait a few seconds for result to appear.
‚Ä¢ If the test is successful, clean any blood off your finger ‚Äì with the cotton wool if necessary.
‚Ä¢ Record the result/details in a monitoring diary.
‚Ä¢ Dispose of the test strip and ensure that the lancet used is put into a sharps bin.

If you have any further questions please speak to your pharmacist.

use the lancing device and a blood glucose meter but most importantly I'm going to teach you some really useful tips that everybody should know so this is my lancing device they are used to obtain a sample of blood usually from the finger for our blood glucose meter here's thefirst tip wash your hands with warm water and normal soap before you beginand make sure you dry them now warming your hands gives the puncture site betterblood flow so it's easier to collect a sample rubbing your hands also helpswith this to load the lancing device it's pretty simple you first twist thiscap off then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used pop it in so thegrooves are in line next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible soplease be careful next get this cap pop it back on twist it on it should clickand that's it tip two use a new lancet every time you use your lancing device (aww sound effect) I know I know it's time-consuming but remember thisevery time you use your lancet the needle becomes dull so one it's gonnahurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection next is the depthindicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it adjusts just howdeep the lancet tip will go into your finger now this isn't something that Ican teach you on a video you'll have to do it a couple of times to get the correctsetting for yourself tip 3 this is what we call the pad of the finger it hasmore nerve endings compared to the side so for less pain when using this go forthe sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skin ifyou're still in pain when you're using this then speak to your healthcareprofessional about getting thinner lancets and lastly pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring-loadedlancet that we fitted earlier place it on your skin firmly and click the buttonso it releases the lancet to puncture your skin for the blood sample so often I see patients blood glucose meters and their control solution hasnever even been opened if you're not testing your machine or your test stripshow can you be sure you're getting the right readings ""do you want me to do your next scene?"" sure so tip 4 was meantto be them by Lewis in the last scene but he couldn't remember his parts so I'll justhave to do it so perform a control solution test each time you open a newvial of test strips or you feel like your meter isn't working properly let'ssay it's giving unexpected results or you may have dropped it or damaged itnow I've left more information in the description below about this so, so continuing on from our lancing device part to test our blood glucose we need toget few things ready so we need a glucose monitor it's specific teststrips that are in date a primed and ready to use lancing device which we didearlier a cotton wool pad a yellow sharps bin and a monitoring diary so we canput our results in at the end next remove a test strip from the vialand insert it into your blood glucose meter it should switch on at this pointand warm up and it will tell you when it's ready for your blood sample nowword of warning for the next scene there will be a little bit of blood so if youdon't like the sight of blood skip forward maybe about 30 seconds I'll putthe information in the description too now let's do it place the lancet devicefirmly on the side of your finger press the release button and remove the devicefrom the puncture site warming up your hands makes it easier to get bloodwithout applying pressure if necessary apply very light pressure to thesurrounding area until a blood drop appears now wipe away the first drop ofblood with a clean cotton swab with the second drop of blood be careful not tosmear it make sure your meter is ready and gently touch the blood drop with thetest strip to collect a blood sample the test strip will draw the blood towardsitself after a few seconds the meter will display your blood glucose levelwrite this down with any other information in the monitoring diary orupdate your electronic records tip 5 diabetic patients tend to build up acollection of different blood glucose meters over the years but it's reallyimportant to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend ofresults if you're going to use different machines you're going to endup with slightly different results and that's not a good thing and that's how it's done one last thing before I gomake sure to remove your used test strips and lancet and put them in your yellowsharps bin the safest way to remove your lancet is by placing the lancet cap on ahard surface and pushing the lancet needle into it now it's no longerexposed and easy to remove so let me know how you get on my guide by leavinga comment below because I'd love to read it thanks for watching hey guys thanks for watching this week'svideo make sure to click that like follow orsubscribe button now to stay up to date with new weekly videos tip 5, can't say it a yellowsharps bin and our monitoring diary to input our results in who says input (Laughter) testing your glucose meter or your test strips how can you be sure that thephone isn't gonna ring"	High Medical Info

0:44 Low glycemic index foods: should you eat them?
1:04 Five problems of the glycemic index
2:07 Why fructose is worse than glucose
4:09 The glycemic load and insulin index

In this video, we‚Äôre going to talk about the huge problem with the glycemic index.

The glycemic index covers a wide range of foods on a scale that rates their ability to raise your blood glucose. A type of food that is less than 55 on the glycemic index is considered low. Between 56 and 69 is considered medium, and 70 to 100 is considered high. 

You wouldn‚Äôt believe the foods that are considered low on the glycemic index:
‚Ä¢ Twix candy bars
‚Ä¢ Pizza hut supreme pie
‚Ä¢ Betty Crocker chocolate cake
‚Ä¢ 100% stone-ground wheat bread

There are five problems with the glycemic index that I want to highlight.

1. It‚Äôs not based on real-world serving size consumption.

2. People never eat just one type of food.

3. Combining protein or fat with sugar creates advanced glycation end products, which are harmful to your body.

4. Low GI fructose is worse than glucose.

5. It ignores the glycemic load and insulin index.

Check out my other videos on the glycemic load and insulin index.

I‚Äôll see you in the next video."	10300000.0	PT5M34S	2d	hd	True		0.0			124295.0	4880.0	0.0	328.0	2008-11-23T18:27:59Z	Dr. Eric Berg DC	1934118033.0	so today i'm going to talk about the huge problem¬†with the glycemic index it gives you some data¬†¬† and so if you're only relying on the glycemic¬†index you're going to set yourself up for a lot¬†¬† of failure because it only tells you a small part¬†of the big picture so the glycemic index covers¬†¬† a range of foods on a scale that rates a food's¬†ability to raise your blood glucose so on the¬†¬† glycemic index a food less than 55 would be¬†considered low and so this is based on using 50¬†¬† grams of absorbable carbs so you're minusing the¬†fiber even though that's a carb it doesn't have an¬†¬† effect on insulin a twix candy bar is considered¬†low on the glycemic index pizza hut supreme pie is¬†¬† considered low on the glycemic index betty¬†crocker chocolate cake is considered low¬†¬† and a hundred percent stone ground whole wheat¬†bread is considered low so right off the bat¬†¬† the glycemic index is not based on real world¬†serving size consumption all right the next point¬†¬† people never eat just one food on the scale for¬†example are you just going to eat a piece of bread¬†¬† no you're going to put something on¬†it like peanut butter and jelly right¬†¬† or some meat and cheese number three when you're¬†combining protein or fat with a sugar or something¬†¬† that turns into sugar pretty quickly you create¬†something called advanced glycated end products¬†¬† which is a type of protein that ends up not¬†being used in the body but it clogs everything up¬†¬† it destroys your vascular system it destroys¬†your vision your circulation your neurons in¬†¬† your brain so this is just one additional negative¬†effect of glucose when it's combined with protein¬†¬† or fat all right number four low glycemic¬†fructose is worse than glucose so on the scale¬†¬† at 100 which is considered high you have glucose¬†and then when we get into the lower part we have¬†¬† a type of sugar called fructose which is only¬†19 which is very low on the glycemic index and¬†¬† then if we combine fructose with glucose we get¬†sucrose and that's why it's about right here but¬†¬† here's the big problem the receptors in your body¬†for glucose are pretty much all over the body the¬†¬† receptors for fructose are only in your liver so¬†when you consume fructose you're creating a lot¬†¬† of damage to the liver because you're not able to¬†spread out this sugar evenly throughout the body¬†¬† it's more concentrated right to the liver¬†and so the liver has to deal with it¬†¬† it gets overloaded and that's when you start¬†creating inflammation additional toxic waste¬†¬† a lot of free radical damage and you create more¬†insulin resistance which then leads to diabetes¬†¬† so fructose is actually a lot worse than glucose¬†and quite a few other sugars have a combination¬†¬† of fructose and glucose like for example agava¬†nectar has a much larger percentage of fructose¬†¬† than glucose even though fructose is low in the¬†glycemic index it actually is going to create a¬†¬† lot more damage relating to your blood sugars than¬†if you were to consume glucose and just as a side¬†¬† note no one consumes straight glucose by itself¬†and it's pretty bizarre if you were to get a¬†¬† glucose tolerance test and check your blood sugar¬†by going to the doctor they may give you a glucose¬†¬† drink and then check your blood sugars after you¬†do that to determine how you react to glucose but¬†¬† in real life you're never consuming straight¬†glucose it's always a combination of things¬†¬† and number five the glycemic index ignores the¬†glycemic load the glycemic load is a much better¬†¬† measurement because it's looking at¬†the glycemic index plus the amount of¬†¬† carbohydrates and so you're going to get a more¬†accurate measurement of what's happening inside¬†¬† the last thing i want to mention is this thing¬†called the insulin index the insulin index which i¬†¬† wrote about in my book is all the non-carbohydrate¬†foods that have effect on insulin this¬†¬† is way better than the glycemic index because it¬†looks at fat and it also looks at protein and just¬†¬† as an fyi the less fat that's in a protein the¬†higher things are on the insulin index and this¬†¬† is why whey protein which is virtually free of fat¬†it's very very concentrated protein is one of the¬†¬† highest things on the glycemic index and so if you¬†knew about that you would always consume protein¬†¬† with more fat you don't want to cook a burger for¬†example that's lean protein you'd want to have the¬†¬† fattiest meat that you could find if you wanted¬†to keep your insulin as low as possible and just¬†¬† to give you more information about the glycemic¬†load i put the video up right here check it out	Low Medical Info

reduced my a1c from above 10 to below 5. why am i qualified to talk about thiswell my name is john collett in march 2018 i got diagnosed with type2 diabetes and within six months i managed toreverse my condition naturally and if i can do it you can doit too so here are the seven steps that ifollowed to live a life medication free of type 2diabetes step 1 decideto reverse your type 2 diabetes. it's really important that you make thatdecision to reverse your type 2 diabetes nomatter what i always remember watching adocumentary of a chap having his leg amputatedand him talking about how he was looking forward to having his fingers amputatednext because he felt so much better not having the pain.you see he got an infection in his leg andbecause the type 2 diabetes was stopping his immune systemfrom being able to heal that infection it had gone dangerousand it was better to amputate the leg otherwise, he would have diedand it was at that point that I made a massive decisionto reverse my type 2 diabetes and it didn't matter what it takesI was going to do it you see i was meant to be the hero of my familyi was meant to be the protector the provider the personthat was there to keep everybody safe i'm sureyou know how that feels i didn't want to be the personthat needed to be protected i was meant to be the heroand i was going to do everything i could to make sure i did thati hope you decide to do the same that then took me unwittingly on to thenext step which was educating myself tony robbinsin his book awaken the giant within he says that abelief is like a table with no legs unless youeducate yourself about the actual facts then when you do that you put the legsunderneath the table you've got a stable table let me giveyou an example where does a camel store it's waterif you said it's humps. unfortunately you're mistakenand don't panic i made that massive mistake i there's even a videoon my youtube channel where i say you a camel stores waterin his humps, I would until someone who was very thought kindlypointed out that that wasn't the case i went and educated myself on the truthand it turns out camels store their water in their blood cellsokay which i did not realize i had this belief and maybeyou've been in the same situation i'm going to stick two videos in thedescription below for you one called diabetes the silent killerwhich is a documentary it from the uk about hospital lifeand people with type 2 diabetes and all the consequences that they have to dealwith and another documentary called sugarthe bitter truth which is then from the university of Californiafantastic documentary about sugar and the consequences of sugar on ourbodies and how that's affecting our bodies on a regular basiswhen you understand when you actually actually have the facts abouthow type 2 diabetes is caused and how that is affecting us as a race inthe western world especially on a day-to-day basisit's going to be much easier for you to educate to make a decisionto reverse your type 2 diabetes step 3 change your environmentwhen you watch those two documentaries one thing should be very clear when youcome out of it is that we were sure we're sugar addictswe're all sugar addicts and you wouldn't sayto a drug addict who wants to get clean of his drug addiction to go livein a drug den so why would you live in an environment wherethere's lots of processed sugar that you're addicted tothrow that stuff out get a bin bag pour it in the bag throw it all out soit is not there to tempt you i know your family eats that food your familylikes eating that food i get it that's exactly what my wifesaid when i started doing this and i said to her you know what i saidthis didn't happen from me eating one bad meal and having a badturn this came from me eating lots and lots of different mealsand it poisoned in my body bit by bit that stuff has poisoned me i'm not goingto allow it to poison you i threw it out and it couldn't tempt meand it was a lot better that way step four we're finally going to talkabout diet one of the things that keeps oncoming up on a regular basis in my facebook group called charging down type2 diabetes and please i'll put a link in the belowcome and join us there is that people get confused about whatfood they should eat the reality is right we tend to eatthe same meals on a week to week basis i do and i'm sure you do tooso what i did is i made a list of all the meals that we eat on a regular basisi identified all the processed and sugary food and i replaced it withreal natural food so to give you an examplespaghetti i replaced that with courgette spaghettirice i replaced with cauliflower rice pizza bases cauliflower pizza basespotatoes are particularly bad i decided then to eat sweet potatoeswhich slightly better but it's debatable there's a lot of debate in the communityabout that i make chips out of sweet potato chipsyeah i carried on eating fruit but i chucked out bananas out of my out of mymy diet i carried on it eating beans or pulsesas they call them i do eat those as well but they'rebecause they're all natural food soi've got some simple rules those simple rules are if theygrow above ground is good and if it grows below groundi limit it i'm not a numbers person i'm not a detailed person and for thoseof you who want carb counts and things like that's finebut that's not what i did at the beginning i didn't concentrate it onthat i did cut down the carbs as much as i canbut i just decided to eat natural food yesi eat meat and fish but you don't have to if that's not something that youwant to do okay but what i always try to do withall the food that i eat i try as much as i can to eat organic foodit's not always feasible money's not always there to eat organic food all ofthe time and sometimes yeah i'll have frozen foodand you know you is better than eatingprocessed sugary food man-made food that's what i did it's up to you whatyou do you make it your own but whatever youdecide to do test everyone's insulin resistance isdifferent so if you're going to try a different ifyou're going to try fruit fruit test it with your blood glucose metersee how it affects you see if it is going to give you massivespikes in your in your blood sugar and if it isthen don't have it they don't need to necessarily follow a strict diet youjust need to find the diet that's going to work for you do that andyou'll be fine and that takes us on to the fifth stepand that is exercise i knew i had to do an exercise so ipicked an exercise that i loved in the past i'd gone to thegym i didn't like it i'd gone jogging ididn't like it but i love wrestling and there was awrestler called DDP yoga diamond Dallas page and he had produceda yoga-based system called DDP yoga and because I likewrestling I thought I'd give that a go and i loved iti absolutely loved it and i recommend you do the same thingfor you what is important here is that you do anexercise one that you love second it has to be anan exercise that's going to make you sweat so going for a walk is a great exercisebut going for a stroll where you don't sweat is probably notgoing to be good enough try and get some speed into it get asweat going how often do i exercise well i tend toexercise at least five times a week but i strongly recommend you exercise atleast three to four times a week and you do about 30 to 40 minutesnot at the beginning and i'm going to put a video here aboutdiabetes and exercise and how i i'm all about the bestway to get into all of that tip six intermittent fasting now i'm going to bestraight up for you i didn't start intermittent fastinguntil after i'd reversed my type 2 diabetes alreadybut what intermittent fasting has done is reduced my blood sugarto another level again which has got my a1c to below 5into the mid 4's okay so i do advise it now what isintermittent fasting intermittent fasting is from is a periodof time where you don't eat so when you have your last meal at nightto the time you have your break fastin the morning so you break your fast that's what it isnow don't think this has some new newfangled thing lots ofreligious festivals like ramadan are all put around fastingit's actually something that's really really good for your bodymost people will like fast between like they'll go a 16 out16 hour period without eating and then an eight hour period while youdo eat there are some people who do moreextreme versions of that and you've got to find out what works for younow what happens when you go into fastingis that your body starts to have time to heal itselfit starts getting rid of all the old cells and it starts puttingnewer cells into your body your body then starts to go into ketosis andstarts to burn the fat in your body forenergy rather than just the carbs that you put into itso that helps you reduce the fat cells in your bodythat you need to get rid of to help with your type 2 diabetesand as a result, it reduces blood sugar it really really works it's a fantasticthing now personally like i said i went on to uheating natural food first and it was a while after i got into the habit ofdoing that did i start doing the fasting ifound it a bit easier to do that but if you think you can go straightinto fasting i need to natural food then you go for itbut me personally i would advise get used to the change in the foodsfirst fast after tip seven change the way you talk to yourselfif you've been watching this video and you've been saying to yourselfi don't like exercise I'm not a good cooki got a sweet tooth now me and you have got something in commonbecause these are the type of things that i used to say to myselfi want you to imagine this if Thomas Edisonand Louis Lattimore who is famous for inventing the light bulbhad said to themselves they weren't great inventorseverything they did fail do you think they would have triedten thousand times to find a way to invent the light bulbno they wouldn't have they would have stoppedbecause of the things that they tell themselves on a regular basishenry ford says that if you think you canor you think you can't you're probably rightand he's spot on if you believe you don't you're very good at exerciseyou're not a good cook you've got a sweet toothyou're not good at keeping things up then you're rightbut if you change that self-talk to yourselfstart saying i love doing exercise i love cookingi love eating healthy food i love being the hero for my familyor i'm not a number i'm a rhino.  you're going to change yourcomplete outlook on the outcome that you wantwhich is reversing your type 2 diabetes naturallynow i'm going to stick a video here aboutdiabetic diets and a low carb diet but just remember you're no longer anumber you're a rhino now

hCg1GRogOlg	UCjYqXp21rHQbjD_R0SsgSqQ	27.0	POLYURIA POLYDIPSIA POLYPHAGIA	"POLYURIA POLYDIPSIA POLYPHAGIA

Are you confused about what polyuria, polydipsia and polyphagia mean, and what you need to know about them in nursing school? 

In this video, I'll break down exactly what polyuria, polydipsia and polyphagia are, and how they relate to the med-surg disorders you're learning about during nursing school. 

Here's a breakdown of what we'll talk about: 

Polyuria means excessive urination, polydipsia means excessive thirst, and polyphagia means excessive hunger. 

These 3 symptoms are sometimes referred to as the ""3 P's"" and probably the most common disorder you'll hear them associated with is diabetes. 

During diabetes, the body can't use glucose for energy, so it uses fat instead. And this leads to a lot of extra glucose in the blood (hyperglycemia). 

So polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia occur as compensatory mechanisms to try to reduce the blood sugar level. 

In this video, I'll go deeper into this concept of how the body uses polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia to reduce blood sugar levels. 

I hope you enjoy it! :)

So you've probably heard these before: polyuria,polydipsia and polyphagia, they are also sometimes called the 3 P's, but what do they actuallymean? So ""poly"" (the first part of the word) meansa lot or many. ""Uria"" refers to urine, ""dipsia"" refers tobeing thirsty, and ""phagia"" refers to eating. So putting those all together, polyuria meansexcessive urination, like the patient is really urinating frequently and a lot. Polydipsia means excessive thirst, like thepatient is really thirsty just all the time, and polyphagia means excessive hunger, sothe patient is hungry all the time. Now what do you need to know about these fornursing school? The key thing you need to be thinking aboutwhen you see these 3 symptoms (polyuria, polydipsia and polyphagia) is - diabetes. In patients with diabetes, there is an increasein the amount of sugar in the blood, so the blood is just filled with sugar. So these three symptoms really make sensewhen you think about it. I mean what are the kidneys going to do whenthe blood is filled with sugar? They're going to try to get rid of it. So they're going to urinate, A LOT. And that's what leads to polyuria. The patient will also be extremely thirstybecause their blood is telling their brain, ""I'm drowning in sugar! Help!"". So their brain will then tell them to drinkmore fluids to help dilute the sugar. And that's what causes polydipsia. They will also be really, really hungry becausetheir body cells are deprived of their best energy source, which is glucose! Even though there is glucose in the blood,with diabetes, the cells can't use it for energy, so their brain thinks they need moreenergy so it tells them to eat...and eat...and eat!

It takes up too much of my time, of my brain space I'd rather be doing other things. Unless you've gotpeople in your family I suppose or a friend who's diabetic, no one reallyknows what it's like. I don't really feel like at the moment but I don't want to wake up with a hypo. Always having to think about what you're eating, what you're doing, where you're going; have you got food for this, have you got an emergency snack, testing my blood. The tablets or the insulin or whatever. That constant thing at the back of your mind. Sometimes you just want to press the pause button. I need to check the blood before I go to bed. I was originally diagnosed with diabetes when I was 37 weeks pregnant. Two days later had the baby. I wasn't diabetic anymore. The second child, as soon as I had the baby the gestational diabetes went. The following January both my children and my husband all got chickenpox at the same time, and I was at work so I was trying to, you know, look after everybody and then in themiddle of all of that, my mother suddenly died. And it wasn't long after that I wastested again and it turned out it was Type 2 diabetes. That was a really horrible time. I didn't realise it was so life-threatening, I didn't realise it wasso serious, I didn't realise how it affected pretty much every bit of your body or it could do. I suppose it was just much harder than I thought than I thought it would be. That's like never gonna fill me up. That's never going to fill me up. I just built up this resentment over the years of going to have my HbA1c testresults and being told that: 'Yeah they're still not very good.' 'No you still need to work on it.' It was all very matter-of-fact. Now I'm not sure whetherI'm breathless and my heart's going because I walked up the hill. Or I'm having a hypo. Sometimes i just want to cry in frustration because I can do exactly the same thing like I have exactly the same breakfast every day and one dayI'll have a hypo after it and one day I won't. I just became really emotional andstarted crying when she gave me my test results because they just kept going upand I thought, gosh when's it ever gonna go down. She asked me if I wanted to seethe psychologist, I didn't even know there was a psychologist and I said yeah and leapt at it because I thought you know anything to help me and I startedseeing the psychologist. One of the things that really made mefeel better I think was just hearing her say that my feelings were justified andI wasn't doing everything wrong. It felt like someone who understood what it was like. The emotional supports been important because it's made me feel notso isolated, it has made me feel that stop blaming myself as well. Some thingsI can't control and I'm still working on it. It's still hard for me, it's still a struggle but having a sympathetic earmade me feel much much better	High Medical Info
jDYKaGxJ1Kc	UCqCsh71eOXZrwqj3oYGfqlg	27.0	How to REVERSE Prediabetes Naturally | Mastering Diabetes	"An estimated 96 million American adults aged 18 years or older had prediabetes in 2019. That's according to the CDC. The country's health protection agency also reports that more than 80% of that group don‚Äôt know they have it. Why? Because prediabetes doesn't usually have any signs or symptoms. Anyone out there who eats the American diet could be walking around and living their life without knowing they have prediabetes. It could even be you or someone you know.

If you don't know you have prediabetes, you're putting yourself at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. What's more, even if you haven't progressed to type 2 diabetes, prediabetes can still lead to heart problems, kidney problems, and damage to blood vessels.

So here's the very first thing that can help you. FACTS.

First, know the risk factors for prediabetes. Here's the list: being overweight, being 45 years or older, having a family member with type 2 diabetes, being physically active less than 3 times a week, ever having gestational diabetes or giving birth to a baby who weighed more than 9 pounds, having polycystic ovary syndrome.

Then, get the blood sugar test.

Information and knowledge backed by science will help you make the right decisions. And the Mastering Diabetes team is here for it.

Robby and Cyrus tell you more about prediabetes and what causes it to help you understand the method they swear by in reversing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. The method guarantees that it works without making you sick on the inside.  We're talking about making lifestyle changes. Most importantly, the power of nutrition is absolutely life-changing. Find out in this video why the low fat, whole food, plant-based diet is the optimal diet for reversing prediabetes.

pre-diabetes of those 96 million people more than 80 percent don't know they have it let us do some quick math for you that is over 76 million people who are living with pre-diabetes and they don't even know what makes it even worse is that pre-diabetes puts you at a significantly increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes heart disease and stroke but fortunately there's some very good news for you which is that pre-diabetes is almost entirely reversible that's right you can almost entirely reverse this condition and you can do so using only your diet as your form of medicine sound crazy well it's not and that's why you'll come away from this video with three things number one first you'll know exactly what pre-diabetes is and how to know if you have it second you'll learn exactly what causes pre-diabetes and some misconceptions about it and finally you'll learn the proven guaranteed way to reverse pre-diabetes using your food as medicine so what is pre-diabetes pre-diabetes is defined as impaired fasting glucose and or impaired glucose tolerance people with pre-diabetes also have an increased risk of developing diabetes and a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease than normal glycemic individuals in layman's terms we can think of prediabetes as the precursor to type 2 diabetes if you're living with pre-diabetes you don't have type 2 diabetes yet but there's definitely a reason to take action blood glucose testing is the simplest way to see if you're living with pre-diabetes you can get this easily done with any doctor now according to the american diabetes association if your fasting glucose is between 100 and 125 milligrams per deciliter or if your glucose is 140 to 199 milligrams per deciliter two hours after a meal then you're living with pre-diabetes you can also take a test called a hemoglobin a1c test this is another simple test that measures your average blood glucose over a three month period and gives your doctors an indication of your risk for both pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes if your a1c is 5.6 or lower you are considered non-diabetic and a1c value between 5.7 and 6.4 is considered pre-diabetes and then a1c greater than 6.5 is considered type 2 diabetes now here's the interesting part and it's a reason that pre-diabetes can be so dangerous it's because most people who are living with pre-diabetes have no symptoms that's right they have zero recognizable symptoms for people that do experience symptoms these complications can include increased thirst frequent urination excess hunger fatigue and blurry vision but when the vast majority of people have no symptoms it can be hard to know that you have pre-diabetes unless you've recently gone in for a checkup with your doctor but just because pre-diabetes is the precursor form of diabetes and just because it doesn't have any symptoms for many people that doesn't mean it's not a sign to make a change to echo the cdc don't let the pre fool you pre-diabetes is a serious health condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough yet to be diagnosed as diabetes that's because pre-diabetes puts you at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes with all the complications that come with it along with heart disease and stroke so we know that pre-diabetes is a decent sign that we should make change but how do we do that well first let's understand what causes pre-diabetes pre-diabetes is caused by a condition known as insulin resistance which we've talked about ad nauseam on this channel insulin resistance is caused by the accumulation of excess fat in tissues that are not designed to store large quantities of fat namely your muscle and your liver tissue this excess accumulation of dietary fat in your liver and muscle prevents insulin receptors in your liver and muscle from recognizing insulin in circulation which forces insulin receptors to down regulate lowers insulin action in both tissues and therefore traps glucose in your blood the net result of that is that your fasting glucose likely increases your average blood glucose likely increases and your a1c value likely increases what's the translation the excess fat is the underlying cause of pre-diabetes and if it gets worse it becomes the underlying cause for type 2 diabetes into the future now for a lot of people this may sound confusing after all the rhetoric in the world of diabetes often focuses on reducing your blood glucose which some people refer to as your blood sugar and while these are important trackers of your ongoing management of diabetes constantly talking about how we need to reduce your blood sugar can lead to some misconceptions about the need to eat carbohydrate energy because carbohydrates can metabolize to glucose some people say that carbohydrates metabolize to sugar and before you know it it becomes very confusing we want to take a moment here to address this misconception because understanding how different nutrients affect your diabetes health is so important to managing pre-diabetes and other forms of diabetes foods that have carbohydrates in them are converted into glucose in your blood this is a natural process and it's how your body gets a large portion of its fuel the problems surrounding pre-diabetes only come in when either your body can't process the glucose adequately or you're giving your body an unhealthy type of carbohydrate now we already talked about a when we mentioned insulin resistance this buildup of fat in your cells means that your body can't process glucose properly but b tends to be the reason so many people become afraid of eating carbohydrate-rich foods there's also forms of carbohydrates referred to as simple carbohydrates or refined carbohydrates and scientific evidence demonstrates that these foods directly cause pre-diabetes and these foods include processed sugar processed foods chips cookies sodas pastries crackers and many artificial flavors and sweeteners that you find in the products that you eat but there's also natural carbohydrates that are considered whole carbohydrates and these come from whole foods like fruits vegetables legumes and whole grains and these foods have been documented by scientific evidence to actually reverse pre-diabetes when you're eating them consistently so this can be very confusing admittedly you can see why some people might just say well forget it this whole carbohydrate nonsense is too confusing i'm just going to avoid them all together but as we're about to explain the natural carbohydrates or whole carbohydrates are actually the secret to managing your diabetes health and reversing pre-diabetes using your food as medicine that's right cyber reversing pre-diabetes now here's the good news pre-diabetes is entirely reversible if you take the right steps let's go back to the cdc for another great quote it's real it's common and most importantly it's reversible you can prevent or delay pre-diabetes from developing into type 2 diabetes with simple proven lifestyle changes and the reason you can prevent or completely reverse pre-diabetes is because we know the cause insulin resistance and we know how to reverse it and in fact there's about a hundred years of evidence-based research showing how to reverse not just pre-diabetes but also type 2 diabetes as well and we're not just making stuff up to confirm our preconceived bias in fact you can review more than 800 studies in the mastering diabetes book that form the body of evidence underlying the mastering diabetes method but we're here to focus on how you can reverse pre-diabetes fast and for that we want to keep it super simple using a low-fat plant-based whole food diet as the basis of your approach it might seem crazy that you can reverse such a life-changing condition with just your diet but trust me when i say it's 100 true in fact the research is clear that a low-fat plant-based whole food diet is the most reliable way to reverse pre-diabetes quickly and permanently but what exactly is a low-fat plant-based whole food diet it doesn't really have a catchy name or abbreviation i mean look l f p b w f but just because it doesn't have a catchy name doesn't mean this diet isn't seriously powerful let's break it down the low-fat plant-based whole-food diet does exactly as advertised it reduces your fat intake to help you reverse insulin resistance focuses on plants rather than meats which range from probably linked to diabetes to definitely linked to diabetes and emphasizes whole foods rather than processed foods to make sure that all of the carbohydrate you're putting in your body are whole food carbohydrates they are the right carbohydrates now that's a lot to take into account when you're deciding what to put into your basket which is why we've handled that tricky part for you and broken up foods into three simple categories the first category are green light foods and these foods you can eat as much as you want they include fruits starchy vegetables legumes intact whole grains leafy greens non-starchy vegetables herbs and spices and mushrooms yellow light foods are next they're still considered healthy but since they're just a little bit higher in their fat content or sometimes a little bit more processed it's important to be cognizant of how much of these you're eating it's easy to eat too many of these foods and a little bit of these foods goes a long way so just be aware these foods include things like avocados nuts and seeds coconut meat soy products and olives and they also include processed foods like single ingredient pastas such as brown rice pasta or chickpea pasta or even sprouted breads and finally there are red light options which we strongly recommend eliminating from your diet if you're looking to reverse insulin resistance these include red meat white meat fish and shellfish dairy products eggs processed sugars oils of any kind and all refined foods like chips soda candy and more trust me when we say that getting rid of just those refined foods themselves can make a massive difference to your overall health and lower your fasting glucose and your a1c value so if you did nothing else but just made that one change you'd be moving in the right direction for sure now we also know that this can be a lot to handle at once because there's a lot of things to have to pay attention to and for that reason we've put together an entire video that goes into great detail about these very helpful dietary guidelines that's not actually the only thing that you can do to reverse pre-diabetes quickly exercise and intermittent fasting are two other strategies that you can also use to get seriously good and long-lasting results from your blood glucose and to completely reverse pre-diabetes altogether overall what we want you to take from this video is that there is a solution and the solution is permanent yeah pre-diabetes is unfortunately quite common and many people you know are probably living with it and they don't even know but thankfully you and them have the power the power is in your hands and all you have to do is arm yourself with education because knowledge is truly power in this situation we have a range of programs from group coaching to private coaching which can all help

Insulin mechanism of action depends on what type of insulin the nurse is injecting into the patient and how that particular insulin peaks in the system (along with the insulin medication's onset and duration). During insulin peak times, the patient is at most risk for hypoglycemia.

everyone it's sarah thread sterner saurian calm and in this video i'm going to be going over in fun pneumonic specifically to help you remember those insulin peak times and what type of insulins are in each category like the rapid the short the intermediate and long so this video is part of a series of the diabetic series I'm going over for in CLECs review so be sure to check out those videos a link should be popping up with the playlist that you can access those videos and also after this video be sure to take the free quiz so you can test your knowledge on how well you know this material ok so the biggest thing that really gets students I never got me during nursing school is remembering which insulins fall into certain categories and what are their onset peak and duration times well in nursing we have to get a little creative on how we remember things because there's so much to remember so first let's go over what insulins fall into each category good techniques to help you do this is write out the word insulin and we're going to use each letter to correlate whether it's rapid short intermediate or long now how can you remember that and rapid is the fastest and long types the longest so I like to remember Ready Set inject love because with diabetics were injecting them so um first thing we're going to do is we're going to use this word and we're going to write out rapid so rapid is the first one it's the fastest so rapid our next is short ready set so short and we use the s over here and we're just going to separate these because this is going to do with Rapids and this is going to deal with shorts and then the next is intermediates which are you're like mph is humulin and the UN in fluent is in the middle intermediate means middle so we're going to write in humulin in because it's MBH then we're just going to separate that from that and then the L those are our long-acting we're just going to rock long to help us remember so now we have it separated into categories now let's fill in which drugs fall into each category okay so human logs the logs like Humalog and Novolog those are our rapid so we have Hume log and then we have no vlog so we have our Rapids next and our Shore acting all short acting insulins are your regular insolence so if it's an insulin name and it ends and are like no Valen are or humulin are that is regular short acting insulin so we're just going to write he's the orange short and right regular I'll remember that and then humulin in those are our intermediate acting remember you was the middle of the word insulin so we know that's intermediate and those are drugs that end in in and like NPH and then our L for the long acting that is levy mirror and Lantis so web Amir and Lantis now we have it by category that can help us understand it how I really recommend you learn this is watch this part of the video over and over get out your sheet of paper and just fill it in yourself and it eventually clicks and whenever you're going to go take your exam just hurry up and write it down so you can refer back to it whenever you're answering those exam questions now the next big thing you have to remember about insulins are those onset peak and duration times the peak is the really big thing you want to pay attention to and because this is when the patient is most at risk for hypoglycemia when that drug is peaking so to help us remember this we have I've developed these mnemonics I try to make the mnemonics go along with the nursing profession because if you can remember something that you can and relate with you will help you remember better so I've separated them too rapid short intermediate and acting each mnemonic the sentence the phrase is going to tell you whether it's Rapids short intermediate or long it's going to tell you the onset the peak and the duration by the numbers in the pneumonic and they're all in order so let me show you what they say okay rapid acting rapid acting the onset is 15 minutes the peak is 1 hour and the duration is 3 hours so remember this phrase 15 minutes feels like an hour during 3 rapid responses this tells us we're dealing with rapid acting because rapid responses 15 is our onset an hour is our peak and 3 is our duration ok let's look at the next one sure acting onset is 30 minutes peak is 2 hours duration is 8 hours remember the phrase short staff nurses went from 30 patients to 8 patients short remind you it is short acting 30 is the onset 2 is a peak and 8 is a duration okay next one intermedia acting onset of these drugs are 2 hours the peak is 8 hours the duration is 8 hours remember the phrase nurses play hero 2 8 16 year-olds okay the end and nurses the pee and play and age and hero that tells you that's NPH remember mph is your intermediate acting insulins 2 represents the onset 8 represents the peak and 16 represents the duration and the last one long acting you're on sets of these this is actually the most easiest one to remember because there's no peak and there's only 2 new numbers you have to remember onset is 2 hours peak there is no peak with long-acting insulins and the duration is 24 hours so remember the phrase the two long nursing shifts never peaked but lasted 24 hours so we know we're dealing with long acting because we're long 2 is the onset there was no there's no page was long-acting and 24 represents the duration so I hope that helps you remember the different types of insulin your patreon sets in your duration be sure to check out this up the other diabetic seri videos that I have and

https://youtu.be/pICzegjGnOY"	15000.0	PT4M59S	2d	hd	False		0.0			99693.0	1987.0	0.0	3.0	2019-11-27T12:20:41.053437Z	Mass General Brigham	3333973.0	insulin resistance describes an abnormal process in the body that goes along with lots of medical conditions that are very common like type 2 diabetes obesity and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps your body break down the energy we eat in nutrients into substances it can use like glucose which is the medical word for sugar and fats in states of insulin resistance the body is not responding normally to levels of insulin they're being produced and as a result we see lots of abnormalities the most common one we see is slightly elevated glucose glucose won't always be elevated but if the body isn't making enough insulin to keep up with insulin resistance then it certainly can be very elevated and lead to type 2 diabetes lots and lots of different things can cause insulin resistance but when we commonly talk about insulin resistance occurring it's usually because people are carrying extra weight and that extra weight ends up getting stored in places it shouldn't be like liver and other tissues and that extra fat sitting in the liver then interferes with the body's ability to respond appropriately to insulin so there are lots of common conditions that go along with insulin resistance one of the most common is fatty liver but there are other conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome type 2 diabetes fatty liver is a very common condition that you could be diagnosed with by a doctor and that is described when people are really carrying extra fat in the liver when you take a big step back the liver is really the factory that processes our energy and carrying extra fat in the liver interferes with a lot of a body's normal ability to function the good news is that when we overeat the fat goes straight to the liver but also when we diet the first place we lose weight is from the liver a common syndrome accompanied by insulin resistance without high blood sugars or diabetes is polycystic ovarian syndrome polycystic ovarian syndrome is a syndrome characterized by irregular menstrual cycles people with pcos often have very high insulin levels that said the high insulin levels in pcos probably to some degree drive the irregular menstrual cycles and even to some degree drive the excess androgen or male hormone levels people often say insulin resistance causes type 2 diabetes and i want to point out that that's not true unless the pancreas is not making enough insulin to keep up with the body's demand so there are many many people who have insulin resistance who are overweight with fatty liver who don't have type 2 diabetes because their pancreas just produces more and more and more insulin and keeps up to a large degree with the body's demand that's not a good situation because those high levels of insulin probably drive other abnormal body processes so even those people would do would benefit from weight loss but you really need insulin deficiency in combination with insulin resistance to lead to type 2 diabetes a lot of what determines insulin resistance is where excess weight is stored some people tend to gain weight in their upper body and be sort of more apple shaped other people tend to store their excess weight in their hips or in their lower body and tend to be more pear shaped it's actually the people who tend to store weight in the what we call the apple distribution the central weight who tend to have much more problems with insulin resistance because the excess weight is being stored in the liver and other abdominal organs interfering with normal metabolic function so the best treatments for insulin resistance are also the best treatments for being overweight or having obesity and also the best ways to just stay healthy overall losing a modest amount of weight actually is very beneficial for insulin resistance and the best way to achieve weight loss is through diet and exercise while many people give up on diet and exercise in fact relatively simple steps like eliminating sugary beverages including juices having portion controlled meals that are balanced with a mixture of carbohydrates protein and fruits and vegetables particularly the healthy carbohydrates are very beneficial for insulin resistance and actually just exercising reduces insulin resistance even in the absence of weight loss a lot of people feel it's very overwhelming to start an exercise program but actually do simple steps like walking 30 minutes over the course of the day even in three separate bouts of 10-minute exercise things as simple as parking the car farther away taking the stairs these things really make a difference over time and help reduce insulin resistance so people often wonder should i take a medicine to treat insulin resistance well insulin resistance isn't really a disease in and of itself it's sort of the abnormal body process that goes along with many other conditions so if you have another condition that needs a medication then by all means medications could be used to treat that condition the good news is that very simple steps such as increasing exercise healthier diet and weight loss can dramatically improve insulin resistance and reduce the risk of a lot of the health conditions that go along with it thanks for joining me today i'm dr deborah wechsler at mass general brigham [Music] you	High Medical Info

This is what youhave to do. 4.7 million people are living withdiabetes. I am one of them I am one of them. My son is one of them.Diabetes is hard to get to grips with. My experience of living with diabetes isdifferent to yours. Managing the regular appointments. It never goes away. It'srelentless. Every choice I make; the food I eat; the pace I walk; even the weatherare going to affect me. It's constant adjustments. Frustration. Restrictive.Resentment. Inconvenient. Worry. Exhausting. No time off. Every single day. Diabetes isnot just a medical issue. The emotional tank runs out very easily when you'regiving care constantly. What I would like to see would be psychological well-beingsupport and actually recognition that looking after mental health is equallyas important the physical health needs. My doctor'spractice is wonderful but I don't think they had the time to be able to sit downwith me and say 'how do you feel about it?'. Emotional support could be very usefulbecause we all break at some point. I'm disappointed, I'm angry. It's about you as ahuman being, your whole person. Talk about it earlier and you're more able tomanage it, you're more able to face up and own it.	High Medical Info

O'Donovan	23248409.0	[Music] in today's video we're going to be covering 12 skin conditions which are associated with diabetes now this is an important topic as it's estimated that 30 of patients with diabetes will experience a skin problem at some stage throughout the course of their disease now in this video there's going to be lots of clinical photographs but before we get started please can i request that if you haven't done so already to subscribe to the channel for weekly medical education videos and remember to like and share the video if you learned something new also please remember that these skin signs aren't necessarily unique to diabetes there are other conditions which can cause these and some can just occur in isolation without any clear underlying cause so without further ado let's get straight into the video and start off with the first associated skin sign which is called acanthosis nigricans now i've published a more detailed video on this already on the channel so please check that out if you haven't done so already by clicking on the link up here but essentially the main symptom of akanthosis nigricans are patches of skin that are darker and thicker than usual some people describe these as feeling like velvety pieces of skin they can appear anywhere on the body but they are most common in the skin folds so things such as the armpits the neck or the groin and you can see that in these photos on screen if you notice these skin changes you should see a doctor there can be other causes for acompositious nigricans such as being overweight cushing's disorder and rarely stomach cancer but again your doctor will evaluate this further in relation to your own clinical picture for more information on our composers and agricultures i've also included a link to the nhs website in the description box of this video so please do check that out as well now the second skin sign to be aware of are diabetic blisters these are also known as baloses diabeticorum or bd or diabetic bullet and you can see examples in the following photos now these might pop up suddenly on your fingers toes hands feet and sometimes on the legs or forearms they're usually white with no red around them now the blisters might look scary but they usually don't hurt and typically they heal on their own in about three weeks they could be a sign that you have diabetes or that your blood sugar levels aren't controlled again if you're noticing that these are an issue you should talk to your doctor or health provider about your symptoms that's because if you're a diabetic you're more likely to be prone to skin infections now the third skin sign is something called granuloma angulari doctors aren't sure how this condition is linked to diabetes but it is they also don't know exactly what causes these tiny bumps around your ankles hands feet or upper arms and elsewhere but it may be a response to inflammation now your doctor may try to treat it with creams or injections however often you don't need treatment if your symptoms are mild and again you're going to see a variety of photos on screen now demonstrating cases of granuloma angulari now the fourth skin sign to be associated with diabetes that you need to be aware of is thickened skin again your doctor might call this by its medical name which is digital sclerosis it can happen with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and the skin on the back of your hands or on your fingers or toes may be thick and waxy now those patches may spread to your arms upper back and shoulders and in severe cases you may have trouble moving your joints due to the thickened skin and you might need physical therapy now the best way to treat this thickened skin is to control your blood sugar i.e making sure that your underlying diabetes is well controlled at number five these are known as shin spots again the medical term and it always has to be a different medical term is diabetic dermopathy now these can look like simple age spots but they're not so high blood sugar from diabetes typically damages small blood vessels this is known as microvascular damage and causes these brownish patches to appear now what they typically look like are roundish rough spots and they usually appear on the shins now dermopathy is usually harmless and should fade away in around 18 months or so but it can also last a long time now moving on to the sixth issue this is a rare but important complication of diabetes and is something called necrobiosis lipodesia and this is the sixth skin sign now necrobiosis means degeneration and death and here small raised red spots on your skin slowly grow larger and shinier and sometimes turn yellow your skin may subsequently thin and split and this causes sores called ulcers now this can be very itchy and it can be very painful but thankfully it's very rare and it's estimated that only one in 300 people with diabetes end up developing this now it's hard to treat but prescription medicines injections or lotions may help and it's really important you see your doctor if you do notice this developing now the seventh skin condition to be aware of are eruptive xanthomatosis now uncontrolled diabetes can lead to breakouts of these pimply waxy bumps on your hands feet arms legs as well as your buttocks now young males with type 1 diabetes are particularly likely to get these the skin eruptions may be tender and itchy but importantly they're not contagious either they don't spread to other people now it's important to talk about how to better control your blood sugar levels to prevent these from occurring in the first place and this should help ease the symptoms of the buns if you do have them now more generally diabetics are more prone to infections of the skin this is both bacterial and fungal infections so these skin conditions are numbers eight and nine so we're going to talk here about infections and the reason that diabetics are more prone to skin infections is because high blood sugar can dry out your skin it can curb your immune system and this raises your risk of skin infections with staphylococcus being the most common bacterial infection for example you might find that you have styes on your eyes inflamed hair follicles this is known as folliculitis or infected nails again you should talk to your doctor if your skin feels swollen itchy painful or hot especially if you know that you've got high blood sugar or diabetes similarly fungi love to hang out in the moist folds of skin and that includes your armpits under the breasts around the nails and the corners of the mouth now you may have heard of something called athlete's foot on your feet or something called jock itch around your genitals or ringworm on your scalp candida albicans is the most common fungus that causes it your doctor can help to treat the infection and again tell you if it's a sign of uncontrolled diabetes they'll do things like checking your blood sugars and taking your hba1c levels now coming in at number 10 we've got xanthelasma now xanthelasma happens when your body collects extra cholesterol around your eyes you might notice flat or slightly raised yellowish growths on or around the eyelid and you can see examples of this on screen here now the deposits aren't harmful or painful but they could signal uncontrolled diabetes high cholesterol or other health problems and often high cholesterol and diabetes fall hand in hand with each other so moving on now to discuss another really important skin condition to be aware of with diabetes and that's diabetic foot ulcers and these have got an annual instance of around two to six percent and they can affect up to 34 of diabetic patients during their lifetime so this is a super important problem to be aware of now risk factors for developing a diabetic foot ulcer include things like type 2 diabetes so type 2 diabetics tend to have fertilizers more commonly than type 1 a duration of diabetes of at least 10 years as well as poor diabetic control being male and a past history of a diabetic foot ulcer now what do you need to look for well these sores can start with nothing more than a small scrape if you've got diabetes especially if it continues to rub in tight-fitting shoes that's in part because of poor circulation that makes it harder for wounds to heal and diabetes can also cause nerve damage so you can't feel the damaged skin as well so you don't know that the skin is damaged so it's really important that you or someone else checks your foot for sauce every day and it's also it's important to ask your doctor or podiatrist how to prevent them now it's really important to try and manage these as soon as they're noticed because there's a risk of secondary infection causing cellulitis or a spreading infection to the bone which is known as osteomyelitis now i am going to make a whole separate video on diabetic foot ulcers with a lot more detail in this video but you just need to make sure you're aware that foot ulcers are a really important issue to be vigilant about now rounding up with number 12 we have vitiligo now this this is more now this is more common if you've got type 1 diabetes but also people with type 2 can get it it's not quite clear why vitiligo destroys cells that normally colour your skin with pigment now you might notice a patchy skin of clearly different colour usually affects the chest stomach or belly as well as the back but sometimes it can happen on the face as well now vitiligo can be treated with medicated creams uv light it's important to use sunscreen to protect the affected skin patches if you do have vitiligo now if you enjoyed this video and learned something new please give it a thumbs up if you've got any questions leave them in the comments section i do tend to reply to all of the comments just takes me a little bit of time to go through everything and remember to hit the subscribe button if you've not done so already that does bring us to the end of this video where we've covered 12 important possible skin signs associated with diabetes now there are many others but this was just a brief overview of 12 important ones for more information on all of these signs please check out the links which i've included in the description box of the video once again thank you

Diabetes nutrition is important because we have over 100 million people in America who are living with blood glucose issues. We need to know what is the best plan for overall health and diabetes health. In this video we learn what type of diabetes nutrition worked best for Meghan. We know that you can get the same results!"	102000.0	PT6M29S	2d	hd	True		0.0			11152.0	318.0	0.0	36.0	2013-10-28T05:42:23Z	Mastering Diabetes	8335128.0	All right, so today we are here with Meghan.¬†Meghan's been living with type 1 diabetes¬†¬† since 2008 and joined our coaching program in¬†February of 2016. She's got an amazing story to¬†¬† tell you and I will let her explain everything.¬†Thanks for being with us today, Meghan. ¬† Thanks for having me. Awesome. So Meghan, why¬†¬† don't you start by educating our listeners here¬†about why you decided to change your nutrition¬†¬† towards low-fat, plant-based nutrition with¬†type 1 diabetes. What was the problem? ¬† The problem was that I was already eating a¬†plant-based diet. I've been eating vegetarian¬†¬† since I was 10 and then vegan for a couple of¬†years before joining this program. But I was¬†¬† eating super low carb vegan foods, and so I was¬†relying heavily on nuts and beans, and I thought¬†¬† it was super healthy but still could not control¬†my blood sugar at all. I had no control over what¬†¬† was happening. Exercise was super hard because¬†it either spiked me or dropped me, and I was just¬†¬† kinda frustrated with not having that control. I joined the group to see what I could do to eat¬†¬† more of the things that I loved, and¬†have more energy and more control. ¬† Give us an idea of your sort of average¬†blood glucose control on a daily basis.¬†¬† Was it in the mid-100's, the 200's,¬†300's? What are we looking at? ¬† It was in the 200's as an average,¬†but with crazy lows and crazy highs.¬†¬† I was never in the mid-range. Got it. Can you maybe tell us what¬†¬† were you actually eating at that time? I was eating a lot of nuts. I actually ate¬†¬† a ton of vegetables, but I was eating¬†really high fat dressings with them,¬†¬† with oils in them. And I ate a lot of beans,¬†and processed, like corn tortillas and things¬†¬† that are still vegan but are super processed. And the reason you were doing that was because you¬†¬† were actually trying to limit carbohydrate intake¬†so that you could limit your insulin use? ¬† Yeah. That's correct. You were one of our best¬†¬† students. You were on every single call. You did¬†not miss one. We tell people, everyone who joins¬†¬† program that if you put in the work, you will get¬†the results. You started doing it. What happened¬†¬† when you started following the program? Like immediately so much more energy first of all,¬†¬† and my insulin needs declined immediately. Like¬†the first 5 days, it was insane how much my¬†¬† insulin usage went down, and how many carbs¬†I could eat for the amount of insulin. ¬† I haven't had a single bladder infection¬†in a year, and that's never happened since¬†¬† I was born because of a congenital¬†defect I had when I was born. ¬† And you're saying you loved the overall¬†benefits, which is something we preach¬†¬† about a lot. Our program is about more than just¬†diabetes numbers and you've experienced that. ¬† Yeah, for sure. My energy levels are crazy high.¬†I don't even have to drink coffee to feel like I¬†¬† have energy all day. It's insane. The benefits are¬†more than just the numbers. It's everything. ¬† So at the beginning of this program you were¬†eating approximately 75 grams of carbohydrates¬†¬† per day, and then when you started doing the¬†program, how many grams of carbohydrate were¬†¬† you eating at that point? Around 250. ¬† And did you make that change quickly, or did¬†you ramp it up slowly until you got to 250? ¬† Really quickly. Because when I cut out the¬†nuts and stuff I was super hungry. I was¬†¬† a lot more carbed than I was used to. So your carbohydrate intake went from about¬†¬† 75 grams per day all the way up to 250.¬†What happened to your insulin use? ¬† It went way down. My basal insulin went down¬†really, really quickly. That s what I first¬†¬† noticed. And then, with a little bit of¬†exercise on top of what I normally do,¬†¬† I noticed my bolus insulin decreased quickly. We say this all the time. People don't really¬†¬† believe it, but you can eat more carbs and¬†take less total insulin. It's exactly what¬†¬† happened for you and I know you always took¬†beautiful pictures of meals so eat, so like,¬†¬† what actual foods were you eating? A ton of bananas, big green smoothies.¬†¬† I'm a busy mom, and so I find green smoothies¬†the fastest way to get my greens in because I¬†¬† don't have the time to sit down and chew¬†through like three pounds of lettuce. ¬† So like date, mango, banana combos, a lot of¬†Mexican inspired stuff with like romaine lettuce,¬†¬† tacos with homemade salsa, lots and lots¬†of good foods that I've been avoiding for¬†¬† years trying not to eat carbs. Were you surprised by what happened¬†¬† to your insulin use?  I honestly would not have¬†¬† believed it if someone had just told me. I had to¬†experience it to believe that it was true.  ¬† I was glad to hear you say that because¬†that happened to me, that happened to Robby,¬†¬† and it's happened to so many people living¬†with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes,¬†¬† but especially those who are injecting insulin,¬†because your expectation is that your insulin use¬†¬† will go up. But then it falls, and it falls fast.¬†And at that point you're like woah, woah, woah! I¬†¬† need to back off before I go hypoglycemic.   And you have unlimited energy. Like you don't have¬†¬† to do much except just change what you eat,¬†and it's insane how quickly it happened.  ¬† So tell us what happened to your A1c¬†value. It started out at an 8.1%.  ¬† Yeah, and as of 3 weeks ago it¬†was a 6.3%, which is the lowest¬†¬† it's been since I was diagnosed.  Unbelievable. Okay, so what we did is,¬†¬† we have all the numbers here to calculate your¬†change in 24-hour insulin sensitivity. So,¬†¬† your 24-hour insulin sensitivity is defined as¬†the total number of grams of carbohydrate you're¬†¬† eating per day, divided by the total number of¬†units of insulin you're injecting, which includes¬†¬† both your bolus and your basal insulin. So at the beginning of this program,¬†¬† you were eating about 75 grams of carbohydrate¬†for about 40 units of insulin, so your insulin¬†¬† sensitivity was approximately a 2. And now that¬†you're eating about 300 grams of carbohydrate per¬†¬† day and your insulin use has fallen to 26 units¬†per day total, your insulin sensitivity is now¬†¬† an 11.5 on a 24-hour basis. Which means, over the¬†course of your program, your insulin sensitivity¬†¬† has increased by 485%.  Insane.  ¬† Which is basically an almost 5-fold¬†increase in your insulin sensitivity,¬†¬† so if you haven't done so already, pat yourself¬†on the back because that's a massive change.¬†¬† And it's something that like you said, you¬†wouldn't have believed it until you actually¬†¬† experienced it and felt it yourself.  Thank you guys so much.  ¬† What would you say to somebody who's¬†considering making this lifestyle change?¬†¬† What type of advice would you give them?  I would say just try it for a month because¬†¬† you seriously won't go back. Just give it all you¬†have for a month, and don't hem and haw about it,¬†¬† just like commit to doing it for a month and¬†you won't go back. That's a guarantee.  ¬† We really appreciate you sharing your¬†story about what's possible and what¬†¬† happens when you follow the program.  Thank you guys for all your help. 	High Medical Info

That's actually true,it's not just a rumor. And in this video I'm gonna tell you five easy steps that you can start today to reverse your type two diabetes within the next few months. I'm Dr. Ken Berry, a family physician with over 20 years of clinical experience, and it's time to reverseyour type two diabetes. But first, let's get somemisconceptions out of the way. First and foremost, I'm not about to try to sell you anything in this video, you can do this for free. You don't need to buy anything from me or click on any linksor do any of that stuff to absolutely reverseyour type two diabetes and keep it reversed forthe rest of your life. You don't need to buyany products whatsoever. You don't need any prescriptionmedications, either pills or insulin injections, toreverse your type two diabetes. One more misconception or myth or lie that you may have been told. You may have even beentold this by your doctor or your dietician, isthat type two diabetes is a chronic progressive condition that you're stuck withfor the rest of your life, that's just gonna keepgetting worse and worse. This is absolutely not true. And I'm in the process ofrenaming this condition, and we're gonna start calling it chronic carbohydrate overdose syndrome. And because you call it that, it takes away the mystery,oh, I have type two diabetes. I don't know why, itmust be genetic maybe, maybe, I don't know, maybe I was born on thewrong day of the week. No, it's none of that. You have type two diabetes because of chroniccarbohydrate overdose syndrome. That's what it is, and so, also the hint to reversing it isactually now in the name. And so that makes it much easier for just regular people tocomprehend what's going on and also immediately see thesolution for type two diabetes. Having type two diabetes is not your fault but it absolutely is your problem. And so you need to pay careful attention to these five easy steps. Maybe write them down, maybewatch this video a second time, so that you can do thisyourself at home for free. There are a few simple labtests that you can get ordered. Not only to find out how bad your type two diabetes is right now, so you can actually see thosenumbers go down over time and know that you arehaving a meaningful impact on your type two diabetes, that you are in fact reversing it. I'm gonna tell you what those labs are. But first I'm gonna tellyou the five easy steps that you can use to reverseyour type two diabetes. Step number one is youneed to stop all sugars, whether added sugars ornaturally occurring sugars. And so obviously, anythingthat has an added sugar, either that you added or thatthe big food manufacturer added the sugar to, you needto stop eating those things. They're actually, they're not really food, they're products thatare made in a factory that you're then convinced that are food and they're gonna spike your blood sugar, which is gonna raise your insulin and you will never ever reverse your type two diabeteseating these things. Number two is, you've gottastop eating all grains. Now the most common culprits are wheat, corn, oats and rice. These are the big guys,but really any grain is gonna be too high in carbohydrates. Now what you obviously,as a type two diabetic, you know that if you eatsugar, your blood sugar goes up and then your pancreashas to deal with that. But what you may not know,what many people don't know, is that any grain, rice, oats, wheat, corn, amaranth, milletquinoa, any of these, they convert immediately into sugar, even before you swallow them. The amylase, which isan enzyme in your mouth, starts to break down the starches into sugar in your mouthbefore you even swallow them. So by the time they get to your stomach, they've turned into what theyreally are, which is sugar. Step three is to remove all vegetable oils from your diet, canola oil, soybean oil, sunflower, safflower, peanutoil, corn oil, cotton seed oil. All of these guys areinflammatory in nature. They have a very high Omegasix to Omega three ratio but they also oxidize very rapidly when you cook with themand also in your body. And many authorities, many experts believe that they also contribute to the pathology or the pathophysiology that ultimately leaves youwith type two diabetes. Step four, is to include lotsof fatty meat in your diet. Fat and protein don'traise your blood sugar any meaningful degree. They also don't raise your insulin level to any meaningful degree. So you can get away witheating lots of fatty meat, which is fat and protein, plustons of vitamins and minerals because meat is full of those. And you're not gonna beraising your blood sugar or your insulin in a pathological manner. Step five is to get anycarbohydrates you do eat from above ground, non starchy vegetables. Okay, some people can reversetheir type two diabetes by eating 100 totalgrams or less each day. Some people have to tighten this up more and need only 50 total gramsof carbohydrates each day. Some people like me, haveto eat 20 total grams a day or even less, to reverse and keep their type two diabetes reversed. It may sound like torture right now, for you to eat a lowcarbohydrate diet like this. But I promise you, the truetorture comes later in life if you continue to allow yourtype two diabetes to exist and to get worse, that's whenthe true torture will begin. Just ask any type two diabetic,who's been type two for 30 or 40 years, and you willunderstand what true torture is. Keep in mind these five easy steps, they work for pre-diabetes as well. And they'll also help type one diabetics be able to use much, much less insulin, therefore saving lots of money. And it will also allow a type one diabetic to have a normal hemoglobinA1C, that's a lab test. Now, since I brought uplab tests, let me tell you about the lab tests that youneed to ask your doctor for, so that you can monitorhow well you're doing on the journey of reversingyour type two diabetes. You want a fasting glucose, for sure. You also want a hemoglobin A1C. That's gonna give youa three-month average of what your blood sugar's been doing. Many doctors stop rightthere and they don't realize that having chronically highinsulin levels is just as bad and just as unhealthyand just as pathological as having a chronicallyhigh blood sugar level. So you're also gonna get a C-peptide and a fasting insulin checked. These are gonna tell you ifyou're eating low carb enough to completely reverseyour type two diabetes and to keep it in remission or to keep it reversedor to keep you cured. However you wanna say it, I think that if you reverseyour type two diabetes, you've earned the right to call it whatever you wanna call it. Using these five easy steps, many people can reversetheir type two diabetes in a month or two months. Some people who have beentype two diabetic for longer or who have a harder time giving up all the carbohydrates,might take two to six months to completely reversetheir type two diabetes. But when you understandthat type two diabetes is actually just chroniccarbohydrate overdose syndrome. You'll understand, and so if your A1C gets better as you cut the carbohydrates but it doesn't go allthe way back to normal, because that's my goal for you, my goal for you is for you to have a hemoglobin A1C of 5.6 or less. I don't even want you to be pre-diabetic. I want you to have a normalA1C and a normal C-peptide. That is the sweet spotwhere you're truly healthy and the possibility ofhaving a long health span and a long lifespan,are within your grasp. I have hundreds of videoson this YouTube channel that will help you reverseyour type two diabetes. If you love veggies, and you wanna include some in your diet, then checkout my keto 101 playlist, I'll put a link either here or here at the end of this video,if you would just be happy eating meat and eggs andcheese and nothing else, then check out my carnivore 101 playlist. If you eat low carbohydrateenough on either one of these, you're gonna reverseyour type two diabetes and in the process, you'regonna actually improve other conditions that I'm notgonna go into on this video. But I have other videos on this channel about other medical conditions that get better whenyou eat what I consider to be a low carbohydrate,proper human diet. If you'd like I have to joinmy army of little Davids, who are fighting the huge Goliath's of big food and big pharma,then consider becoming a patron. There's a Patreon link down below. It's a quick sign-up. You can throw a buck or two myway so that I have more time and resources to makevideos just like this to help other peopleunderstand you can reverse many of the chronic medical diseases that you thought youwere stuck with for life.

like of exercise type 2 diabetes junk food all of the above maybe well what if i told you that the real culprit is your genes dr arrigan i'm an endocrinologist and a diabetes specialist i'm here to help you win over your diabetes so keep watching yes even if you're genetically disadvantaged that's right according to a recent research the majority of genetic variations associated with type 2 diabetes are told to act by the subtle changes in the amount the timing and the location of the gene activity we call this expression gene expression these changes in the expression of the genes involved in many aspects of type 2 diabetes including the development and function of beta cells in your pancreas and the release and the processing of the insulin and even the cell's sensitivity to the effects of the insulin can you believe that everything is determined by genetics the pancreas as you know is the organ that makes the insulin some of us are not genetically blessed and end up gaining weight this could be due to genetic predisposition so blame your mom and dad but lifestyle factors actually like poor eating habits and the lack of adequate exercise and so forth can do that as well now when the weight gain and luck of exercise combine with the genetically poor insulin reserve in the pancreas then that leads to diabetes well don't fret there are things that you can do even if what i call your pancreatically challenged knowing what is wrong with you gives you 50 of the solution right well i agree that being pancreatically challenged and is is a chronic condition that requires vigilance and a positive attitude okay but it is also an opportunity really to be awesome now being pancreatically challenged diabetic in short is a chance to show the world that you can actually overcome any obstacle no matter how difficult it may seem it is a chance to inspire others and to prove that anything is possible if you set your mind to it so if you are pancreatically challenged don't let it hold you back embrace it and use it as a fuel for your awesomeness you'll be glad you did even if you're pancreatically challenged remember you are chronically awesome if you did not know what the pancreas is let me tell you a little more pancreas is a small nice pear-shaped shaped organ located behind your stomach it produces enzymes actually primarily that help you digest the food and it also makes the hormones to regulate the metabolism primarily insulin and glucagon now studies have shown that there are certain genetic factors that can predispose a person to developing the condition now in particular there are at least 150 dna variations that have been linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes can you believe that most of these variations are actually quite common and present in both people with diabetes and without so if you don't have diabetes don't you that i'm good each person has a unique combination of these variations which helps to determine their individual likelihood of developing the disease it's getting interesting right well while the genetics may play a role in type 2 diabetes it is not the only factor we know that lifestyle choices such as the diet the exercise they play a significant role therefore therefore it is important to remember that the genetic risk is just one piece of the puzzle and yet an important one now when it comes to type 1 diabetes we have a slightly different story here there is a gene called ins gene that provides instructions for producing the hormone insulin which is necessary for the control of your blood sugar levels in the blood all the time but if there are like real hits or real mutations in that ins gene then you will have type 1 diabetes now this disorder is characterized by an inability to produce insulin and increase susceptibility to infections so most of them type 1 diabetes you know develops in a childhood or early adolescence and so forth and they're not certainly obese individuals but it can occur at any age i have really diagnosed type 1 diabetics in their 80s like that's not once twice multiple times and symptoms of type 1 diabetes are not really much different than type 2 you know if you're really uncontrolled you will have thirst frequent urination weight loss and fatigue and so forth and if you don't treat it both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can lead to quite serious complications and you know that like like heart disease the kidney damage and so forth now since diabetes type 1 starts with an at an earlier age it is important to get control of it earlier to prevent early complications well let me tell you my friend diabetes is a tricky business just because you have the genetic background that predisposes you to diabetes it does not mean you will develop diabetes anyway so you have to be careful what i'm trying to say here be careful carefully listen if you have diabetes it doesn't mean you will have diabetes complications either the best way to protect yourself from diabetes is to live a healthy lifestyle today get regular checkups and if you develop diabetes there are many treatments either pharmaceutical or herbal all the holistic whatever you want to do they're all available right now we are not in the middle ages okay this is a modern era and whatever your preference is anybody can help you who has interest and passion and treating diabetes hopefully a specialist but anybody you can trust who knows you understands you your wishes your your behavior your beliefs work with them and you will be able to prevent complications if you are on it so don't despair if diabetes runs in your family don't say oh it's in my family i'm gonna die anyways no with a little care and effort you can stay healthy and complication free yes diabetes is a serious disease but it doesn't have to be a life sentence of feeling like crummy all the time right so be open-minded do everything you can to help yourself and most importantly stay motivated again don't despair don't let diabetes take you down once you have made the decision to fight back against the disease half the battle is already worn now it is up to you to keep up with the good work by making healthy lifestyle choices staying on top of your glucose levels and luckily there are many resources available like this channel this youtube channel watch

MD]	29834408.0	are you using the ketogenic diet to reverse medical problems if you are I insist you check your morning fasting glucoses to ensure that you actually are accomplishing those goals if your blood sugar is elevated above 100 you are going to stall out you are going to not be able to lose that weight and those chronic problems will not reverse let me show you why that's happening and how to fix it you can't talk about elevated blood sugars in the morning without mentioning the word dawn phenomenon that dawn phenomenon comes because those elevated blood sugars were emptied from a special molecule that molecule is a bunch of glucoses packed together when you have too much blood sugar in your body that your body doesn't know what to use it for it can't hang out in your blood it must be stored one of the places that we store that blood sugar is in strings of blood sugar of strings of sugar called glycogen glycogen is hundreds of glucose molecules packed into a a snowflake like image of glucose the benefit of this tightly packed glucose is that we can package it pretty quickly and we can undo it pretty quickly this package called glycogen has two places that we store it one place is your liver and the second place is in your muscles that tightly packaged glucose can be done really rapidly and it can be undone really rapidly as soon as blood sugars start to drop the body will tap into that rapidly reversible blood sugar if you keep eating and you fill up all of the storage where glute glycogen can go the body does a second thing with the storage of that excess sugar it turns it into fat making fat out of blood sugar doesn't happen nearly as fast as make is making glycogen and undoing that stored fat is much harder as well so when we see elevated blood sugars in the morning we know that you're not going to lose weight you're not going to have a reversal of those medical problems because you still haven't emptied all of the storage of that stored blood sugar called glycogen let's take a little closer look again that first place of storage is done in a liver this healthy liver has a little sprinkling of glucose because the patient goes has not had an abundance of glucose for many years most of my patients that come in wanting the ketogenic diet are not this lucky they have elevated blood sugars that have gone on and on and on and it's really changed what their liver looks like their liver is often two to three times as big as it should be and there are parts of the liver filled with fat again all of the possible places that we could store that glucose are taken up and now we're packing fat into their liver as we compare a healthy liver to a fat filled liver there is a special process that happens first thing in the morning as you are sleeping throughout the night your body wasn't eating glucose it was undoing uh the stored glucose found in glycogen so throughout the night your liver donated some of the glycogen to keep your blood sugars stable but first thing in the morning as your part of the globe is turning and the sun is rising there's a special signal that comes from your brain the specific part of your brain is called the pineal gland and it's using a hormone called cortisol as the cortisol leaves the pineal gland and heads to a healthy liver you'll see several glucose eggs that the liver and fill the blood sugars with a a rise in blood sugar and then a return to normal in a not so healthy liver the amount of glycogen the amount of glucose exiting the liver is much more abundant and lasts longer so the question is do you have a healthy liver or is it not so healthy I contend the answer is in your morning fasting glucose take a look at this rise in glucose it starts in the 70s Peaks a little above 80 and then returns to Baseline that's what happens in healthy patients this patient has a much higher rise in glucose bubbling that glucose over a hundred and it doesn't quite return to Baseline until well into the middle of the night this patient's style of eating is typical of a ketogenic diet where there's two meals throughout the day and as I ask them to improve that morning fasting glucose I asked I I instruct them to get those meals earlier in the day the first meal that most people move is the one that's around lunchtime that I will begin eating at first thing in the morning and indeed that overlap of the morning rising cortisol as well as the first meal turns into one surge in their blood sugars the Baseline blood sugar does not return to normal it's that second meal that really is the heart of the pathology that continues to block their inability uh to lose weight and that reversal of medical problems it's only when I can get the patient convinced that moving that second meal out of the darkness and into the afternoon that their bodies will let go of the fat and they will start to reverse those medical problems again not only do we get the second meal around three o'clock in the afternoon I really encourage them to try not to eat so much at that second meal this allows those blood sugars to return to normal and during this drop in blood sugars is when their liver will donate all that extra glycogen storage into the bloodstream and continues to enhance their health Improvement the key to those patients improving is this extended time when they haven't eaten and that morning rise will happen every time the sun comes up the amount of rise in glucose will only lessen when their liver gets healthier I don't know if you've ever had success at getting that evening meal moved into the sunlight hours but I've really struggled with that you want to see what I did check out the next video I'll show you what we did in our family	High Medical

Diabetes refers to a group of conditions characterized by a high level of blood glucose, commonly referred to as blood sugar. Too much sugar in the blood can cause serious, sometimes life-threatening health problems.
There are two types of chronic diabetic conditions: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Pregnant women may acquire a transient form of the disease called ‚Äúgestational diabetes‚Äù which usually resolves after the birth of baby. Pre-diabetes is when the blood sugar level is at the borderline: higher than normal, but lower than in diabetics. Prediabetes may or may not progress to diabetes.
During food digestion, carbohydrates - or carb - break down into glucose which is carried by the bloodstream to various organs of the body. Here, it is either consumed as an energy source - in muscles for example - or is stored for later use in the liver. Insulin is a hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas and is necessary for glucose intake by target cells. In other words, when insulin is deficient, muscle or liver cells are unable to use or store glucose, and as a result, glucose accumulates in the blood.
 In healthy people, beta cells of the pancreas produce insulin; insulin binds to its receptor on target cells and induces glucose intake. 
In type 1 diabetes, beta cells of the pancreas are destroyed by the immune system by mistake. The reason why this happens is unclear, but genetic factors are believed to play a major role.  Insulin production is reduced; less insulin binds to its receptor on target cells; less glucose is taken into the cells, more glucose stays in the blood. Type 1 is characterized by early onset, symptoms commonly start suddenly and before the age of 20. Type 1 diabetes is normally managed with insulin injection. Type 1 diabetics are therefore ‚Äúinsulin dependent‚Äù.
In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas produces enough insulin but something goes wrong either with receptor binding or insulin signaling inside the target cells. The cells are not responsive to insulin and therefore cannot import glucose; glucose stays in the blood. In other words, type 2 diabetics are ‚Äúinsulin resistant‚Äù.  Here again, genetic factors predispose susceptibility to the disease, but it is believed that lifestyle plays a very important role in type 2. Typically, obesity, inactive lifestyle, and unhealthy diet are associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes. Type 2 is characterized by adult onset; symptoms usually appear gradually and start after the age of 30. Type 2 diabetes accounts for about 80 to 90% of all diabetics. Management focuses on weight loss and includes a low-carb diet."	1070000.0	PT3M45S	2d	hd	True		0.0			3446692.0	35904.0	0.0	810.0	2014-01-02T04:50:59Z	Alila Medical Media	142574106.0	Diabetes refers to a group of conditions characterizedby a high level of blood glucose, commonly referred to as blood sugar.

MEDICAL ANIMATION TRANSCRIPT: You or someone you know may have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. This video will help you understand what it is and why it's important to keep it under control. Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar level is too high. Carbohydrates are substances your body uses to make energy. After you eat food that contains carbohydrates, it eventually goes to your small intestine. In your small intestine, the food is broken down into a single sugar molecules called glucose. The cells in your small intestine soak up the sugars, which pass into your bloodstream. When the blood reaches your pancreas, it detects the high amount of sugar in your blood. Normally, this causes your pancreas to put a chemical called insulin into your bloodstream. The insulin reduces the amount of sugar in your blood to a healthy level. How does insulin do this? As the blood moves through your body, the insulin and sugar exit the bloodstream into your tissues to reach your cells. Most cells have structures on their surfaces called insulin receptors. When insulin flows by, it attaches to the receptors. The insulin acts like a key in a lock to open up the cell so the sugar can get inside. Now your cell can use the sugar to make the energy it needs to work properly. And your blood sugar level drops back to its normal range. If you have type 2 diabetes, cells don't respond to insulin as they should. This is called insulin resistance. When this happens, your insulin cannot unlock the cells too let sugar in because the locks, or insulin receptors, are missing or aren't working. As a result, sugar is locked out of your cells. When sugar can't get into your cells, it builds up in your bloodstream. This is a condition called hyperglycemia. In response to the high blood sugar levels, your pancreas makes more and more insulin. The overworked cells in your pancreas try to keep up, but they slowly lose their ability to make enough insulin. These problems may lead to the symptoms of type 2 diabetes. If you have questions about type 2 diabetes or any medications you have been prescribed, speak with your doctor. It is important to take your medications as directed by your doctor. Tell him or her about any side effects you have.

In diabetes mellitus, your body has troublemoving glucose, which is a type of sugar, from your blood into your cells. This leads to high levels of glucose in yourblood and not enough of it in your cells, and remember that your cells need glucoseas a source of energy, so not letting the glucose enter means that the cells starvefor energy despite having glucose right on their doorstep. In general, the body controls how much glucoseis in the blood relative to how much gets into the cells with two hormones: insulinand glucagon. Insulin is used to reduce blood glucose levels,and glucagon is used to increase blood glucose levels. Both of these hormones are produced by clustersof cells in the pancreas called islets of Langerhans. Insulin is secreted by beta cells in the centerof the islets, and glucagon is secreted by alpha cells in the periphery of the islets. Insulin reduces the amount of glucose in theblood by binding to insulin receptors embedded in the cell membrane of various insulin-responsivetissues like muscle cells and adipose tissue. When activated, the insulin receptors causevesicles containing glucose transporter that are inside the cell to fuse with the cellmembrane, allowing glucose to be transported into the cell. Glucagon does exactly the opposite, it raisesthe blood glucose levels by getting the liver to generate new molecules of glucose fromother molecules and also break down glycogen into glucose so that it can all get dumpedinto the blood. Diabetes mellitus is diagnosed when the bloodglucose levels get too high, and this is seen among 10% of the world population. There are two types of diabetes - Type 1 andType 2, and the main difference between them is the underlying mechanism that causes theblood glucose levels to rise. About 10% of people with diabetes have Type1, and the remaining 90% of people with diabetes have Type 2. Let‚Äôs start with Type 1 diabetes mellitus,sometimes just called type 1 diabetes. In this situation, the body doesn‚Äôt makeenough insulin. The reason this happens is that in type 1diabetes there is a type 4 hypersensitivity response or a cell-mediated immune responsewhere a person‚Äôs own T cells attack the pancreas. As a quick review, remember that the immunesystem has T cells that react to all sorts of antigens, which are usually small peptides,polysaccharides, or lipids, and that some of these antigens are part of our own body‚Äôscells. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to allow T cells thatwill attack our own cells to hang around, and so there‚Äôs this process to eliminatethem called ‚Äúself-tolerance‚Äù. In type 1 diabetes, there is a genetic abnormalitycauses a loss of self-tolerance among T cells that specifically target the beta cell antigens. Losing self-tolerance means that these T cellsare allowed to recruit other immune cells and coordinate an attack on these beta cells. Losing beta cells means less insulin, andless insulin means that glucose piles up in the blood, because it can‚Äôt enter the body‚Äôscells. One really important genes involved in regulationof the immune response is the human leukocyte antigen system, or HLA system. Although it‚Äôs called a system, it‚Äôs basicallythis group of genes on chromosome six that encode the major histocompatibility complex,or MHC, which is a protein that‚Äôs extremely important in helping the immune system recognizeforeign molecules, as well as maintaining self-tolerance. MHC is like the serving platter that antigensare presented to the immune cells. Interestingly, people with type 1 diabetesoften have specific HLA genes in common with each other, one called HLA-DR3 and anothercalled HLA-DR4. But this is just a genetic clue right? Because not everyone with HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR4develops diabetes. In diabetes mellitus type 1, destruction ofbeta cells usually starts early in life, but sometimes up to 90% of the beta cells aredestroyed before symptoms crop up. Four clinical symptoms of uncontrolled diabetes,that all sound similar, are polyphagia, glycosuria, polyuria, and polydipsia. Let‚Äôs go through them one by one. Even though there‚Äôs a lot of glucose inthe blood, it can‚Äôt get into cells, which leaves cells starved for energy, so in response,adipose tissue starts breaking down fat, called lipolysis, and muscle tissue starts breakingdown proteins, both of which results in weight loss for someone with uncontrolled diabetes. This catabolic state leaves people feelinghungry, also known as polyphagia. ‚ÄúPhagia‚Äù means eating, and ‚ÄúPoly‚Äùmeans a lot. Now with high glucose levels, that means thatwhen blood gets filtered through the kidneys, some of it starts to spill into the urine,called glycosuria. ‚ÄúGlycos‚Äù refers to glucose, ‚Äúuria‚Äùthe urine. Since glucose is osmotically active, watertends to follow it, resulting in an increase in urination, or polyuria. ‚ÄúPoly‚Äù again refers to a lot, and ‚Äúuria‚Äùagain refers to urine again. Finally, because there is so much urination,people with uncontrolled diabetes become dehydrated and thirsty, or polydipsia. ‚ÄúPoly‚Äù means a lot, and ‚Äúdipsia‚Äù meansthirst. Even though people with diabetes aren‚Äôtable to produce their own insulin, they can still respond to insulin, so treatment involveslifelong insulin therapy to regulate their blood glucose levels and basically enabletheir cells to use glucose. One really serious complication with type1 diabetes is called diabetic ketoacidosis, or DKA. To understand it, let‚Äôs go back to the processof lipolysis, where fat is broken down into free fatty acids. After that happens, the liver turns the fattyacids into ketone bodies, like acetoacetic acid and beta hydroxybutyric acid, acetoaceticacid is a ketoacid because it has a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. Beta hydroxybutyric acid on the other hand,even though it‚Äôs still one of the ketone bodies, isn‚Äôt technically a ketoacid sinceits ketone group has been reduced to a hydroxyl group. These ketone bodies are important becausethey can be used by cells for energy, but they also increase the acidity of the blood,which is why it‚Äôs called keto-acid-osis. If the blood becoming really acidic can havemajor effects throughout the body. Patients can develop Kussmaul respiration,which is a deep and labored breathing as the body tries to move carbon dioxide out of theblood, in an effort to reduce its acidity. Cells also have a transporter that exchangeshydrogen ions (or protons‚ÄîH+) for potassium. When the blood gets acidic, it is by definitionloaded with protons that get sent into cells while potassium gets sent into the fluid outsidecells. Another thing to keep in mind is that in additionto helping glucose enter cells, insulin stimulates the sodium-potassium ATPases which help potassiumget into cells, and so without insulin, more potassium stays in the fluid outside cells. Both of these mechanisms lead to increasedpotassium in the fluid outside of cells which quickly makes it into the blood and causeshyperkalemia. The potassium is then excreted, so over time,even though the blood potassium levels remain high, overall stores of potassium in the body‚Äîwhichincludes potassium inside cells‚Äîstarts to run low. Patients will also have a high anion gap,which reflects a large difference in the unmeasured negative and positive ions in the serum, largelydue to this build up of ketoacids. Diabetic ketoacidosis can happen even in peoplewho‚Äôve already been diagnosed with diabetes and currently have some sort of insulin therapy. In states of stress, like an infection, thebody releases epinephrine, which in turn stimulates the release of glucagon. Too much glucagon can tip the delicate hormonalbalance of glucagon and insulin in favor of elevating blood sugars and can lead to a cascadeof events we just described‚Äîincreased glucose in the blood, loss of glucose in the urine,loss of water, dehydration, and in parallel a need for alternative energy, generationof ketone bodies, and ketoacidosis. Interestingly, both ketone bodies break downinto acetone and escape as a gas by getting breathed out the lungs which gives a sweetfruity smell to a person‚Äôs breath. In general though, that‚Äôs the only sweetthing about this illness, which also causes nausea, vomiting, and if severe, mental statuschanges and acute cerebral edema. Treatment of a DKA episode involves givingplenty of fluids, which helps with dehydration, insulin which helps lower blood glucose levels,and replacement of electrolytes, like potassium; all of which help to reverse the acidosis. Now, let‚Äôs switch gears and talk about Type2 diabetes, which is where the body makes insulin, but the tissues don‚Äôt respond aswell to it. The exact reason why cells don‚Äôt ‚Äúrespond‚Äùisn‚Äôt fully understood, essentially the body‚Äôs providing the normal amount of insulin,but the cells don‚Äôt move their glucose transporters to their membrane in response, which rememberis needed for glucose to get into the cell, these cells therefore they have insulin resistance. Some risk factors for insulin resistance areobesity, lack of exercise, and hypertension, and the exact mechanisms are still being explored. For example, an excess of adipose tissue‚Äîorfat‚Äîis thought to cause the release of free fatty acids and so-called ‚Äúadipokines‚Äù,which are signaling molecules that can cause inflammation, which seems related to insulinresistance. However, many people that are obese are notdiabetic, so genetic factors probably play a major role as well. We see this when we look at twin studies aswell, where having a twin with type 2 diabetes increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes,completely independent of other environmental risk factors. In Type 2 diabetes, since tissues don‚Äôtrespond as well to normal levels of insulin, the body ends up producing more insulin inorder to get the same effect and move glucose out of the blood. They do this through beta cell hyperplasia,an increased number of beta cells, and beta cell hypertrophy, where they actually growin size, all in this attempt to pump out more insulin. This works for a while, and by keeping insulinlevels higher than normal, blood glucose levels can be kept normal, called normoglycemia. Now, along with insulin, beta cells also secreteislet amyloid polypeptide, or amylin, so while beta cells are cranking out insulin they alsosecrete an increased amount of amylin. Over time, amylin builds up and aggregatesin the islets. This beta cell compensation, though, isn‚Äôtsustainable, and over time those maxed out beta cells get exhausted, and they becomedysfunctional, and undergo hypotrophy and get smaller, as well as hypoplasia and dieoff. As beta cells are lost and insulin levelsdecrease, glucose levels in the blood start to increase, and patients develop hyperglycemia,which leads to similar clinical signs that I mentioned before, like polyphagia, glycosuria,polyuria, and polydipsia. But unlike type 1 diabetes, there is generallysome circulating insulin in type 2 diabetes from the beta cells that are trying to compensatefor the insulin resistance. This means that the insulin/glucagon balanceis such that diabetic ketoacidosis doesn‚Äôt usually develop. Having said that, a complication called hyperosmolarhyperglycemic state (or HHS) is much more common in type 2 diabetes than type 1 diabetes- and it causes increased plasma osmolarity due to extreme dehydration and concentrationof the blood. To help understand this, remember that glucoseis a polar molecule that cannot passively diffuse across cell membranes, which meansthat it acts as a solute. So when levels of glucose are super high inthe blood (meaning it‚Äôs a hyperosmolar state), water begins to leave the body‚Äôs cells andenter the blood vessels, leaving the cells relatively dry and shriveled rather than plumpand juicy. Blood vessels that are full of water leadto increased urination and total body dehydration. And this is a very serious situation becausethe dehydration of the body‚Äôs cells and in particular the brain can cause a numberof symptoms including mental status changes. In HHS, you can sometimes see mild ketonemiaand acidosis, but not to the extent that it‚Äôs seen in DKA, and in DKA you can see some hyperosmolarity,so there is definitely overlap between these two syndromes. Besides type 1 and type 2 diabetes, thereare also a couple other subtypes of diabetes mellitus. Gestational diabetes is when pregnant womenhave increased blood glucose which is particularly during the third trimester. Although ultimately unknown, the cause isthought to be related to pregnancy hormones that interfere with insulin‚Äôs action oninsulin receptors. Also, sometimes people can develop drug-induceddiabetes, which is where medications have side effects that tend to increase blood glucoselevels. The mechanism for both of these is thoughtto be related to insulin resistance (like type 2 diabetes), rather than an autoimmunedestruction process (like in type 1 diabetes). Diagnosing type 1 or type 2 diabetes is doneby getting a sense for how much glucose is floating around in the blood and has specificstandards that the World Health Organization uses. Very commonly, a fasting glucose test is takenwhere the person doesn‚Äôt eat or drink (except water, that‚Äôs okay) for 8 hours and hastheir blood tested for glucose levels. Levels of 100 110 milligrams per deciliterto 125 milligrams per deciliter indicates prediabetes and 126 milligrams per deciliteror higher indicates diabetes. A non-fasting or random glucose test can bedone at any time, with 200 milligrams per deciliter or higher being a red flag for diabetes. Another test is called an oral glucose tolerancetest, where a person is given glucose, and then a blood samples are taken at time intervalsto figure out how well it‚Äôs being cleared from the blood, the most important intervalbeing 2 hours later. Levels of 140 milligrams per deciliter to199 milligrams per deciliter indicate prediabetes and 200 or above indicates diabetes. Another thing to know is that when blood glucoselevels get high, the glucose can also stick to proteins that are floating around in theblood or in cells. So that brings us to another type of testthat can be done which is the HbA1c test, which tests for the proportion of hemoglobinin red blood cells that has glucose stuck to it - called glycated hemoglobin. HbA1c levels of 5.7% to 6.4% indicates prediabetes,and 6.5% or higher indicates diabetes. This proportion of glycated hemoglobin doesn‚Äôtchange day to day, so it gives a sense for whether the blood glucose levels have beenhigh over the past 2 to 3 months. Finally, we have the C-peptide test, whichtests for this byproduct of insulin production. If the level of C-peptide is low or absent,it means the pancreas is no longer producing enough insulin, and the glucose can‚Äôt enterthe cells. For type I diabetes, insulin is the only treatmentoption. For type II diabetes, on the other hand, lifestylechanges, like weight loss and exercise, along with a healthy diet and oral antidiabeticmedications, like metformin and several other classes, can sometimes be enough to reversesome of that insulin resistance and keep blood sugar levels in check. However, if oral antidiabetic medicationsfail, type II diabetes can also be treated with insulin. Something to bear in mind is that insulintreatment comes with a risk of hypoglycemia, especially if insulin is taken without a meal. Symptoms of hypoglycemia can be mild, likeweakness, hunger, shaking, but they can progress to loss of consciousness and seizures in severecases. In mild cases, drinking juices, or eatingcandy, or sugar, may be enough to bring blood sugar up. But in severe cases, intravenous glucose shouldbe given as soon as possible. The FDA has also recently approved intranasalglucagon as a treatment for severe hypoglycemia. Ok, now, over time, high glucose levels cancause damage to tiny blood vessels, called the microvasculature. In arterioles, a process called hyaline arteriolosclerosiswhere the walls of arterioles where they develop hyaline deposits, these deposits of proteins,and these make them hard and inflexible. In capillaries, the basement membrane canthicken and make it hard for oxygen to easily move from the capillary to the tissues, causinghypoxia. One of the most significant effects is thatdiabetes increases the risk of medium and large arterial wall damage and subsequentatherosclerosis, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes, major causes of morbidity andmortality for patients with diabetes. In the eyes, diabetes can lead to retinopathyand evidence of that can be seen on a fundoscopic exam that shows cotton wool spots or flarehemorrhages - and can eventually cause blindness. In the kidneys, the afferent and efferentarterioles, as well as the glomerulus itself can get damaged which can lead to a nephroticsyndrome that slowly diminishes the kidney‚Äôs ability to filter blood over time - and canultimately lead to dialysis. Diabetes can also affect the function of nerves,causing symptoms like a decrease in sensation in the toes and fingers, sometimes calleda stocking-glove distribution, as well as causing the autonomic nervous system to malfunction,and that system controls a number of body functions - everything from sweating to passinggas. Finally, both the poor blood supply and nervedamage, can lead to ulcers (typically on the feet) that don‚Äôt heal quickly and can getpretty severe, and need to be amputated. These are some of the complications of uncontrolleddiabetes, which is why it‚Äôs so important to, diagnose and control diabetes througha healthy lifestyle, medications to reduce insulin resistance and even insulin therapyif beta cells have been exhausted. While type 1 diabetes can not be prevented,type 2 diabetes can. In fact, many people with diabetes can controltheir blood sugar levels really effectively and live a full and active life without anyof the complications.	High Medical Info

In this video we have discussed types of diabetes and early signs and symptoms of diabetes.
There are mainly 3 types of diabetes:
Type ‚Äì I: where insulin is completely absent
Type ‚Äì II: where either insulin formation decreases, or the body is not responding to the insulin formed.
Gestational diabetes - Gestational diabetes develops in pregnant women who have never had diabetes

How can you tell if you have¬†diabetes? 
Most early symptoms are from higher-than-normal levels of glucose.

What are the early signs of Diabetes?

Hunger and Fatigue
The food we eat is converted into glucose, which our cells use for energy. Our cells need insulin to take in glucose. But in diabetes there isn‚Äôt enough or any insulin. So the glucose can't get into them and you have no energy. This can make you hungrier and more tired than usual.

Peeing more often and being thirstier
A person with diabetes may need to pee a lot more, than an average person.

Dry mouth & Itchy Skin
Because the body is using a lot of fluid to make urine, there's less moisture available for other things. This can make you dehydrated, and your Mouth may feel dry. 

Blurred vision
Changing fluid levels in body can make the lens in Eyes swell up. 

What are the symptoms of Diabetes
These appear after the glucose level is high for a long time.

Fungal or yeast infections:
Excess glucose in your body promotes fungal infection. In diabetes there can be fungal infections
Between fingers and toes
Under breasts
In or around genital organs.

Slow-healing sores or cuts
Over time, high blood sugar can affect the blood flow and it may even cause nerve damage. 
That makes it hard for your body to heal wounds.

Pain or numbness in feet or legs
This is also a result of nerve damage caused by high blood glucose.

Unplanned weight loss
If your body can't get energy from the food you consume, then it will start burning muscle and fat for energy.  This leads to the unintentional weight loss.

Nausea & Vomiting
When the body burns fat, it makes ketones. These ketones can build up in blood to dangerous levels. These Ketones can make you feel sick.

What are the warning Signs of Diabetes Complications
Signs of diabetes' complications may include:
Slow-healing sores or cuts
Itchy skin (usually around the vaginal or groin area)
Frequent yeast infections.
Recent weight gain.
Velvety, dark skin changes of the neck, armpit, and groin, called Acanthosis nigricans
Numbness and tingling of the hands and feet
Decreased vision
Impotence or erectile dysfunction (ED)

A serious complication of prolonged increase in blood glucose is Diabetic Coma
This serious complication can even lead to death. 
It may occur with either type of diabetes, though it‚Äôs more common in type 2. 

Other complications of diabetes are:
Heart disease and stroke
Diabetic retinopathy
Glaucoma
Cataract
Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
Neuropathy
Gum diseases

When to visit a Doctor
If you're older than 45 or have other risks for diabetes, it's important to get tested. 
When you diagnose the condition early, you can avoid nerve damage, Heart trouble, and other complications.

mellitus before we begin let me tell you there are mainly three types of diabetes mellitus type 1 here insulin is completely absent type 2 where either insulin formation decreases or the body is not responding to the insulin formed third one is gestational diabetes the gestational diabetes develops in pregnant women who have never had diabetes in this video i will tell you about the first two types of diabetes that is type 1 and type 2 diabetes which are the most common forms so how can you tell if you have diabetes mellitus from here on instead of saying diabetes mellitus i will just say diabetes the most early symptoms are from higher than normal levels of glucose and glucose is a kind of sugar in your blood both type 1 and type 2 diabetes have some of these same tell-tale warning signs so they share their warning signs though these warning signs may be mild especially in case of type 2 diabetes and it may even go unnoticed while in case of type 1 diabetes the symptoms usually occur early and are much more severe than type 2 let's now take a look at the early signs of diabetes first one hunger and fatigue the food that we eat is converted into glucose and this glucose is utilized by our cells for energy but our cells need insulin to take in glucose and if the body doesn't make enough or any insulin or if the cells are resistant to insulin then this glucose can't get into them and you have no energy this can make you even more hungrier and more tired than usual second sign is peeing more often and being thirstier a person with diabetes may need to pee a lot more than an average person normally your body reabsorbs glucose as it passes through the kidney but when the blood sugar goes up as in the case of diabetes the kidneys may not be able to bring it all back in and this causes the body to make more urine and this takes more fluid so this will make you very thirsty and you will drink more water so when you drink more water you will also pee more third is dry mouth and itchy skin because the body is using a lot of fluid to make urine there's less moisture available for other things and this can make you dehydrated and your mouth may feel dry and dry skin can make you itchy fourth is blurred vision the changing fluid levels in the body can make the lens in the eye swell up and since the lenses change shape and can't focus properly our vision is blurred let's now take a look at the symptoms of diabetes the symptoms appear after the glucose level is high for a long time the symptoms include fungal or yeast infection the fungal infection may be seen in both men and women that are suffering with diabetes the excess glucose in your body promotes this fungal infection and these infections can grow in any warm moist skin folds that include between finger and toes under the breasts in or around genital organs second slow healing source or cuts so over the time high blood sugar can affect the blood flow and it may even cause nerve damage so the affected blood flow and nerve damage makes it hard for your body to heal wounds then pain or numbness in feet or legs so the pain and numbness is also a result of nerve damage caused by high blood glucose next is unplanned weight loss if your body can't get energy from the food that you consume then the body starts to burn muscle and fat because it requires energy and because it is burning muscles and fat this leads to unwanted weight loss next is nausea and vomiting now when the body burns fat it makes ketones these ketones can build up in blood to dangerous levels when the body keeps on making ketones and these ketones can make you feel sick so it is the ketone accumulation that causes the feeling of nausea and vomiting now diabetes is a disease that can lead to certain complications and the science which can act as a warning for these complications include first slow healing source or cuts second itchy skin usually it is around the vaginal or growing area third frequent yeast infection or you can say frequent fungal infection then recent weight loss velvety dark skin changes of the neck armpit and growing area which is called acanthosis nigricans numbness and tingling of the hands and feet decreased vision impotence or erectile dysfunction a serious complication of prolonged increase in blood glucose is diabetic comma diabetic comma can even lead to death it may occur with either types of diabetes though it is more common in type 2 diabetes it happens when the blood sugar gets too high and your body gets severely dehydrated and its symptoms include first blood sugar above 600 milligram per deciliter dry parched mouth extreme thirst warm dry skin that doesn't sweat you may even have a high fever sleepiness or confusion vision loss hallucinations and weakness on one side of your body so these are some warning signs that would indicate a pending diabetic comma so when do we visit a doctor or when should we consult a doctor if you are older than 45 or you have any other risk for diabetes it is important that you get tested when you spot the condition early you can avoid heart trouble nerve damage and various other complications so as a general rule consult your doctor if you feel very sick weak and very thirsty if you are peeing a lot if you have a bad belly ache if you are breathing more deeply and faster than usual if you have sweet breath that smells like nail polish remover see this sweet breath is a sign of very high ketones so it means that you have high ketone in your blood under these conditions it is important that you get yourself tested by a doctor so that's all for now hope you like this video and if you do like this video do like comment and share this video thank you	High Medical Info

Most of the food we eat is turned into glucose that our bodies use for energy. The pancreas, an organ that lies near the stomach, makes a hormone called insulin that helps glucose get into the cells of our bodies. When you have diabetes, your body doesn‚Äôt make enough insulin or can't use its own insulin as well as it should. This causes glucose to build up in your blood. There are several types of diabetes. In type 1 diabetes the body does not make insulin. In type 2 diabetes, the body does not use insulin well and may not make enough insulin. This is the most common form of diabetes. Gestational diabetes happens when a woman's body does not use insulin well while she is pregnant. It raises her risk for type 2 diabetes and raises her child‚Äôs risk of getting diabetes. Diabetes is serious. Over time, high blood glucose levels may cause many health problems including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and foot sores and amputations.	High Medical Info

Diabetes can affect many parts of our body, including our skin. Many skin changes are visible in the later stage of diabetes but some changes are an early indicator of diabetes. 

Signs of diabetes:

1. Acanthosis nigricans:
It is a dark patch of velvety skin on the back of your neck, armpit or groin areas. It is commonly seen in obese people.

2. Skin tags:
Numerous skin tags with blackish discolouration of skin could be a sign of high blood glucose level. These growths are most common on the eyelids, neck, armpit, and groin region

3. Necrobiosis lipoidica:
This skin condition often begins as small raised solid bumps that look like pimples. As it progresses, these bumps turn into patches of swollen and hard skin. The patches can be yellow, reddish, or brown in colour.

You may also notice:
- The surrounding skin has a shiny porcelain-like appearance
- Visible blood vessels
- Itchy and painful skin
- The skin disease goes through cycles where it is active, inactive, and then active again

The medical name for this condition is necrobiosis lipoidica. If you see this type of skin lesion, get tested for diabetes

4. Digital sclerosis (skin hardening or thickening)
You can see thick, tight, waxy skin that develops on the back of the hands. The finger joints stiffen and become difficult to move.

Controlling blood glucose level and physical therapy may be helpful in this situation.

5. Diabetic dermopathy:
This skin condition causes spots that create a barely noticeable depression in the skin. It‚Äôs common in people who have diabetes. It usually forms on the shins. 

6. Bullosis diabeticorum:
People with diabetes may see a large blister, a group of blisters, or both. The blisters tend to form on the hands, feet, legs, or forearms and look like the blisters that appear after a serious burn. However, these blisters are not painful.

7. Eruptive-xanthomatosis:
Eruptive-xanthomatosis is commonly seen in uncontrolled diabetes. When these bumps appear, they often look like pimples. Usually seen on the buttocks, thighs, crooks of the elbows, or backs of the knees.

8. Frequent skin infections:
People who have diabetes tend to get frequent skin infections. It could be bacterial or fungal. 

Bacterial infections commonly seen in diabetes are
- Styes,
- Folliculitis or infection of the hair follicle
- Carbuncles or deep infections of the skin and the tissue underneath

Fungal infection is also very common in diabetes.
Common fungal infections include jock itch, athlete's foot, ringworm (a ring-shaped itchy patch), and vaginal infection that causes itching.

9. Open sores and wounds:
Having high blood sugar (glucose) for a long time can lead to poor circulation and nerve damage. This makes it hard for your body to heal wounds & especially true on the feet. These open wounds are called diabetic ulcers.

If you have diabetes, you should check your feet every day for sores and open wounds.

10. Itching:
Localized itching is often caused by diabetes. It can be caused by a yeast infection, dry skin, or poor circulation. 

If you notice one or more of the above mentioned signs then its important that you correlate with other risk factors like obesity, family history of diabetes or having a sedentary lifestyle. Just having only one sign cannot be directly linked to diabetes. It can be associated with other diseases also. 

But if you are 40+ and fall into this high risk groups then it‚Äôs better to check blood sugar level on a regular basis. Early detection of diabetes and precautionary measures can prevent many future complications

name is diabetic dermopathy it usually forms on The Shins in rare cases you will see it on the arms thighs trunk or other areas of the body the spot doesn't cause any symptom for these reasons many people mistake them for eight spots now unlike eight spots these spots and lines usually start to fade after 18 to 24 months diabetic dermopathy can also stay on the skin indefinitely it's rare but people with diabetes can see blisters suddenly appearing on their skin you may see a large blister a group of blisters or both the blisters tend to form on the hands feet legs or forearms and look like the blisters that appears after a serious burn now unlike the blisters that develop after a burn these blisters are not painful eruptosanthematosis is commonly seen in uncontrolled diabetes when these bumps appear they often look like pimples unlike pimples they soon develop a yellowish color you will usually find these bumps on the buttocks thighs Crooks of the elbow or the backs of the knees they can form anywhere though now no matter where they form they are usually tender and itchy this yellow bumps disappear promptly when the diabetes is well controlled people who have diabetes tend to get frequent skin infections it could be bacterial or fungal bacterial infections commonly seen in diabetes are styes which is an infection of the glands of the eyelid folliculitis or infection of the hair follicle carbon Cults or deep infections of the skin and the tissue underneath fungal infection is also very common in diabetes it is most commonly seen in warm moist folds of the skin like under the breast around the needles between the fingers and the toes corners of the mouth armpits and groin region common fungal infections include jock itch ethylates foot ringworm and vaginal infection that causes itching having high blood sugar for long time can lead to poor circulation and nerve damage you may have developed this if you have uncontrolled diabetes for a long time poor circulation and nerve damage can make it hard for your body to heal wounds this is especially true on the feet these open wounds are called diabetic ulcers if you have diabetes you should check your feet every day for sores and open wounds localized itching is often caused by diabetes it can be caused by yeast infection dry skin or poor circulation when poor circulation is a cause of itching the itchiest area may be the lower parts of the legs now you may be able to treat itching yourself limit how often you bathe particularly when the humidity is low use mild soap with moisturizer and apply skin cream after bathing so to conclude this if you notice one or more of the above mentioned signs then it's important that you correlate with other risk factors like obesity family history of

pancreas is an organ that plays a role in the digestive system producing digestive enzymes that work to break down carbohydrates fats and proteins the pancreas also makes insulin which enters the bloodstream and is a hormone that metabolizes sugar in the blood when there are increased levels of sugar in the blood the pancreas is signaled to produce and secrete insulin this insulin is circulated throughout the body by the blood which allows sugar to enter the cells of the body glucose or sugar is the preliminary source of energy for cells in the body that make up muscles and other important tissues glucose essentially is the fuel for muscle cells in the body when someone has type 1 diabetes their pancreas produces little to no insulin this means they do not have enough insulin to allow glucose into the cells leading to sugar buildup within the blood this can have very serious even deadly repercussions type 2 diabetes is a chronic medical impairment in the way the body metabolizes sugar and uses it as fuel with type 2 diabetes there are two significant issues the pancreas does not produce enough insulin and the cells within the body do not respond very well to insulin this means that the cells take in less sugar which increases the sugar levels in the bloodstream and there is not enough insulin to regulate the movement of the sugar into the cells people with pre-diabetes have blood sugar levels that are higher than normal but are not high enough to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes symptoms of type 1 diabetes include excessive hunger excessive thirsts blurred vision fatigue frequent urination and a dramatic weight loss in short periods of time next patients with pre-diabetes usually don't experience any symptoms but if they start to experience increased thirst frequent urination excessive hunger fatigue and blurred vision that means that they have progressed into type 2 diabetes high blood sugar which is common among diabetes patients can cause gastroparesis which impacts the way food is digested during digestion the stomach muscles tighten which helps to move food along the gastrointestinal tract gastroparesis can lead to nerve damage

developing diabetes type 1 diabetes must be managed with insulin insulin injections the treatment for diabetes was discovered over a hundred years ago people with diabetes used to have to use syringes needles vials of insulin and alcohol swabs and take multiple shots per day now many pharmaceutical companies offer more discreet and convenient methods such as an insulin pen which is a small pen size device which holds an insulin cartridge think of an ink cartridge in a pen the amount of insulin required can be dialed in and the release mechanism will allow the needle to penetrate just under the skin and deliver the required amount of insulin an insulin pump is another option it's a battery operated pump and computer chip that allows the user to control the exact amount of insulin being delivered an insulin pump eliminates the need for the user to take multiple shots per day since it's constantly attached to the body through an infusion set which consists of a thin plastic tube and a small needle called a cannula which is inserted under the skin usually in the abdomen in very severe cases a pancreatic transplant may be recommended to those with type 1 diabetes with 1 in 3

It is a protein, meaning it is made up of a string of amino acids, and it also contains an atom of iron, giving our blood its red color. The main job of hemoglobin, and our red blood cells, is to deliver oxygen from the lungs to other tissues and organs in our bodies that will use it. Hemoglobin A is the most common type of hemoglobin found in adults. But there are other forms. For example, fetal hemoglobin is called hemoglobin F, and is normally present in a fetus and newborn. Or, people with sickle cell disease have hemoglobin S. It is important to know that individual red blood cells last about 120 days in our circulation, before their function declines and they are removed. During the lifespan of a red blood cell, the hemoglobin molecules inside accumulate a form of modification called glycation. Glycation is the unregulated attachment of a sugar molecule, glucose, to amino acids in a protein. For hemoglobin, there are some chemically preferred spots where the glucose can attach. And the most commonly form glycated hemoglobin is known as hemoglobin A1C. The more glucose that is available to react, the more hemoglobin A1C will form. In people with diabetes, their ability to remove glucose from the blood is impaired, leading to higher concentrations of blood glucose. Since there is more glucose available for glycation, people with diabetes generate more hemoglobin A1C during the lifespan of a red blood cell, versus people who do not have diabetes. So, measuring the amount of hemoglobin A1C, typically expressed in the U.S. as a percentage of all hemoglobin, gives an indication of the long term amount of glucose in the patient's blood, during the lifespan of their red cells. In other tissues of the body, the same type of glycation is happening on other proteins, leading to various types of damage. The damage elsewhere results in common complications found in diabetes such as kidney disease and visual problems like retinopathy. Years ago, several large studies showed that by controlling the amount of glucose, and limiting the amount of glycation damage, the onset of these complications could be delayed or prevented. A1C could be used to determine how well the glucose was being managed. A1C became a surrogate, or proxy, for the amount of damage taking place in other tissues. And groups such as the American Diabetes Association were now able to make recommendations to doctors and patients about A1C treatment goals for adequately controlling diabetes, and improving quality of life. In addition, the test is now also used to diagnose diabetes, which is often viewed as an improvement over historical tests of glucose tolerance. But A1C is not the right test for everyone. Since the test is a substitute for measuring how well someone is able to control their glucose, there are conditions in which A1C does not really indicate this. For example, normal A1C values are based on red blood cells circulating for a typical period of about 120 days. In some people, their red cells don't last that long, due to things like anemia or sickle cell disease. So their cells don't accumulate the same amount of glycation, they would if they lasted longer. And their percentage A1C may not really show how poor their glucose control is. Or, in patients who have received blood transfusions, their A1C will indicate the glucose control in the blood donor until those cells are removed from circulation. This is good to keep in mind. A1C is a great test for most people, but it is not a good indicator of glucose control in everyone. ‚ô™	High Medical Info

A1C test is a blood test used to diagnose diabetes and monitor the progress of a treatment plan. The test result reflects the average blood sugar levels in the past 3 months. 
A1C is a type of glycated hemoglobin - a hemoglobin that is bound to glucose. Hemoglobin is the major protein of red blood cells. A1C forms as a result of interaction between red blood cells and sugar in the blood. The higher the blood glucose levels, the more glucose binds to hemoglobin, the greater the amount of A1C. The A1C blood test reports the percentage of hemoglobin that is bound to glucose.
Once a hemoglobin is glycated, it remains that way in the blood, until the red blood cell carrying it is removed from the circulation. Because the average lifespan of a red blood cell is 3 to 4 months, A1C measurement represents the status of blood glucose for the past 3 months or so.
A normal blood glucose level corresponds to an A1C result of less than 5.7%. An A1C level higher than 6.5% indicates diabetes. Between 5.7 and 6.5% is prediabetes. 
An estimated average glucose level, eAG, measured in concentration units, milligrams per deciliter or millimoles per liter, can be calculated and often reported in addition to the A1C percentage. eAG helps patients link A1C to the numbers they obtain at home using a blood sugar measuring device. 
A1C is an important tool for managing diabetes. For most diabetics, the goal is to bring A1C level down to 7% or less. However, patient‚Äôs age and other health conditions must be taken into account when setting goals. In general, younger patients who don‚Äôt often experience severe low glucose, known as hypoglycemia, need lower goals to avoid diabetes complications in the many years ahead. Older patients or those having frequent low-glucose episodes, may have a higher goal.
It is important to note that several factors can affect the accuracy of A1C test result, in which case, unless corrections can be made, A1C cannot be used to assess blood glucose levels. For example, people with blood disorders such as sickle cell disease, thalassemia, or hemolytic anemia may have a lower than expected A1C because their red blood cells have a shorter lifespan. Iron deficiency anemia, on the other hand, is associated with increased red blood cell lifespan and falsely high A1C measurements. Some people of African, Mediterranean, or Southeast Asian descent may have uncommon forms of hemoglobin that produce falsely high or low results. Certain kidney and liver diseases may affect the turnover rate of red blood cells and give rise to inaccurate A1C readings. Finally, recent blood loss or transfusion will also skew the test results."	1070000.0	PT3M53S	2d	sd	True		0.0			771301.0	7680.0	0.0	150.0	2014-01-02T04:50:59Z	Alila Medical Media	142574106.0	A1C test is a blood test used to diagnosediabetes and monitor the progress of a treatment plan.

‚Ä¢ For people living with diabetes, monitoring blood glucose through finger-prick tests is the norm. 
‚Ä¢ However, these tests, although necessary, are quite limited in measuring blood glucose as they only measure the current amount and do not indicate any trends. 
‚Ä¢ This means that your overall blood sugar might be fine even if your current fasting levels are abnormal. 
‚Ä¢ This is where the A1C test comes. 
‚Ä¢ Introduced in the 1980s, the hemoglobin A1C test is important in monitoring diabetes as it helps check blood glucose levels over the previous two or three months. 
‚Ä¢ The test is also used for screening and diagnosing diabetes and prediabetes. 
‚Ä¢ It is convenient too, as it does not require a person to be fasting and can be given at any time. 
‚Ä¢ Let‚Äôs look at the A1C test in detail: 
What Does it Measure? 
‚Ä¢ The A1C test measures the amount of glucose attached to hemoglobin in the body. 
‚Ä¢ Hemoglobin is the protein used by the body‚Äôs red blood cells to carry and transport oxygen. 
‚Ä¢ Its typical lifespan lasts for around 3 months. 
‚Ä¢ During this time, glucose attaches to it in the form of glycates. 
‚Ä¢ Because of that, the presence of glucose can also be checked for up to 3 months. 
‚Ä¢ If the glucose attached to hemoglobin is low, you will have low A1C and vice versa. 
What Are Normal Levels? 
‚Ä¢ People with a glycated level of less than 5.6 are considered normal, with 5 being the usual amount for people without diabetes. 
‚Ä¢ Levels between 5.6 and 6.4 indicate prediabetes. 
‚Ä¢ A1C levels of 6.5 and above are considered to be an indication of diabetes. 
Who Needs It? 
‚Ä¢ An A1C test provides a more extensive look into blood glucose levels than a finger prick test. However, most diabetics do not need frequent tests. 
‚Ä¢ The finger prick tests are usually enough to give you a strong idea about your condition. 
‚Ä¢ Frequent A1C tests are required if: 
1. You are pregnant 
2. Your treatment is being monitored and adjusted
3. You are dealing with type 1 diabetes
4. You and your doctor have certain blood glucose targets
‚Ä¢ However, one test is necessary for those with diabetes, prediabetes, or a family history of diabetes. 
What Can Influence an A1C Test? 
‚Ä¢ A1C tests are often not reliable as they can give a reading of .5 higher or lower. 
‚Ä¢ A doctor is likely to get the tests repeated to get an average reading to use, possibly ignoring abnormalities. 
‚Ä¢ You might also get false results if you are suffering from anemia, liver diseases, or kidney diseases. 
What Does High A1C Indicate? 
‚Ä¢ If your A1C test shows an abnormally high read, it usually indicates uncontrolled diabetes. 
‚Ä¢ The conditions this places you at risk of include:  
1. Kidney disease
2. Cardiovascular disease
3. Eye damage
4. Nerve damage
5. Numbness and tingling
6. Slower wound healing
7.

101 nursing tips 101 nursing tips is an online discussion and again it'll go to your email when people post new tips so this is a great way to share nursing tips with each other and get some nursing tips from us while our nursing tip today is going to be on hemoglobin a1c hemoglobin a1c is the amount of glucose that has bound up to hemoglobin now glucose is going to bind up to hemoglobin in the greatest concentration that ever was in other words the higher the concentration of glucose then the greater the hemoglobin a1c so for example here a patient's got a blood glucose level of approximately 125 that means that so many glucoses are going to bind up to hemoglobin and what we're measuring is the amount of hemoglobin that is glice elated or other words that has glucose attached to it so in this case here with a glucose level of 125 your patient would have a hemoglobin a1c level of approximately 6% if however the patient's blood glucose level were to rise and say maybe go up to 240 milliliters per deck later then the hemoglobin a1c level would rise - in other words more glucose would bind the hemoglobin causing the overall amount of glice elated hemoglobin to increase which would be now maybe 10% so the hemoglobin a1c tells us about our overall glucose control in other words what is the average kind of glucose that the patient is having now the way this works is that hemoglobin is going to bind glucose permanently and it doesn't let it go so it's bound up there permanently now the reason why this will not stay at 10% forever is because your red blood cells die and the more hemoglobin is made so hemoglobin is replaced on a regular basis bringing in brand-new hemoglobin with no glucose attached to it which is going to start to drop the hemoglobin a1c level unless you have a chronically high blood glucose just to give you an idea of what the hemoglobin a1c means as far as the patient's average glucose in this study here they found that the average glucose in our patient on the right-hand side in milligrams per deciliter as associated with the hemoglobin a1c so the a1c level v indicated an average glucose of about 97 hemoglobin a1c level of 6 126 etcetera so you can see that our average blood glucose level is going up considerably with each percentage point on our a1c level well it has been widely recognized that having a low blood glucose is associated with low complications in our patients so we've taken this information which was originally studied in surgical intensive care patients and now we've applied it to every patient and say what every patient should have low blood glucose levels everybody should have their blood glucose maintained within a normal range of 70 to 110 well that's not always going to be the case and in some patients having a low blood glucose level will actually cause more complications so let's take a look at that long term complications of blood glucose tend to be directly and literally a related to the hemoglobin a1c so there's a linear line between our nc concentration and the number of long-term complications that are associated with diabetes so certainly we want to have the lowest hemoglobin a1c level possible but in some patients like patients on dialysis or patients who have multiple core morbidities and those kind of patient populations then we run into problems we run into some problems with having those low hemoglobin a1c levels now the reasons could be that maybe having a low blood glucose level when the patient becomes dialyzed and has other electrolyte disturbances going on that may be that causes more stress to the body patients who have multiple comorbidities might need a higher blood glucose level especially at certain times of the day or night in order to be able to manage those we don't really know exactly what the mechanism is these patients are also going to be at a higher risk for hypoglycemia that's one of the possible mechanisms that patients on dialysis patients with multiple comorbidities may be at a higher risk for hypoglycemia and maintaining a lower hemoglobin a1c level is actually going to lead to more problems well in this study they looked at patients who are on dialysis the diabetic patients on dialysis and they looked at their hemoglobin a1c and they looked at their mortality now you can see from the chart here the hemoglobin a1c is on the left the hazard ratio which is the risk that the patient's going to die is on the right so certainly we want to be as close to one on this as possible and the patients in the range of seven to nine as their hemoglobin a1c had the lowest mortality in this group so maintaining low hemoglobin a1c levels actually increased mortality obviously high hemoglobin a1c levels increased mortality too so what can you do with this information well we can do some teaching for our patients about their glucose monitoring how important it is to maintain a normal blood glucose but maybe the patient needs a more moderate target rather than going for a target between 70 and 110 maybe we need to raise that target up a little bit the American diabetic Association is now recommending a hundred and forty as the target for hospitalized patients so that we're not overdoing it and possibly bottoming people out so the glucose target may need to be adjusted for our patients anti-diabetic medications they found the patients in their study who had the best hemoglobin a1c levels were on the highest doses of anti-diabetic medications the patients who had the worst or in other words the highest hemoglobin a1c levels were on the fewest anti-diabetic medications so maybe that's something that we need to work on with our patients he says my diabetic research shows the test subjects are 98 percent more likely to take their diabetic pills of the pills or covered in chocolate I would be so this is an area we can do some patient teaching on too now if you'd like to get more information from this article you can find the article by going to Medscape com view article seventy five forty fifty it's a report done by dr. port and colleagues diabetics on dialysis do better with a higher hemoglobin a1c level if you'd like to get more nursing tips you can get them sent right to your cell phone this we send out a text every Wednesday so just once a weeks you don't have to be worried about being

#InsulinePump  #Diabetes #Type1Diabetes

MEDICAL ANIMATION TRANSCRIPT: If you have been diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, you can use an insulin pump to control your blood glucose level. An insulin pump is a battery powered device used to deliver rapid acting insulin to the body through a catheter replacing the need for periodic injections. The parts of the device include a battery powered pump, a disposable reservoir of insulin, and a computer chip programmed to deliver precise dosages. To help maintain a consistent glucose level, you can program the pump ahead of time for continuous insulin delivery 24 hours a day. An insulin pump can help you adjust your blood sugar immediately. You can also program the pump to deliver larger bolus doses of insulin right before eating to accommodate or cover the amount of carbohydrates you are about to eat. Once you have determined your glucose level with a glucose meter, you can program your pump to send the correct amount of insulin into your body. Insulin travels from the pump through an infusion set, including a flexible tube attached to a soft plastic cannula inserted just under the skin. Using an insulin pump may help you lead a more flexible lifestyle while helping you maintain a more consistently stable glucose level. Studies show that regular monitoring and maintenance of glucose levels help prevent long term diabetic complications, such as blindness, kidney disease, heart disease, and stroke.

DESCRIPTION: Plant-based diets appear to protect against metabolic syndrome, also known as syndrome X, which is characterized by the so-called ""deadly quartet,"" abdominal obesity, high fasting sugars, high triglycerides, and high blood pressure. We see this same step-wise progression towards lower disease risk the more plant-based one's diet gets with high blood pressure (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/), cataracts (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-cataracts-with-diet/), diabetes (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/), and obesity (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/thousands-of-vegans-studied/). So it's not all or nothing-- just adding more healthy plant foods to crowd out some of the animal and junk foods in the diet can offer significant protection. It does appear, though, that to maximize one's benefits one has to move towards maximizing the proportion of plants in the diet.

It's been estimated to afflict about a quarter of the American population. How do we stop it? How do we prevent it? Well, if it's all about obesity, the level of fat in our blood and high blood pressure, then that seems like a job for plant-based nutrition! We didn't know for sure, though, until recently. Even after adjusting for lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise, risk was highest in those eating non-vegetarian, intermediate risk for thoseeating semi-vegetarian and lowest in those eating vegetarian, cutting the odds of having metabolic syndrome by more than half."

VbwRYFMPZS4	UCdBrXvlJn60zgpIQcZ0Fe7w	28.0	Insulin Receptor and Type 2 Diabetes	"Part 2 of two animations about type 2 diabetes. 
This animation describes the role of the insulin receptor in type 2 diabetes. It focuses on the very recent discovery of how the hormone insulin actually binds to the receptor on the surface of cells, as determined by Professor Mike Lawrence's laboratory at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. 

Insulin binds to the receptor protein on the cell surface and instructs the cell to take up glucose from the blood for use as an energy source. In type 2 diabetes, we believe that insulin binds to the receptor normally, but the signal is not sent into the cell, the cells do not take up glucose and the resulting high blood glucose levels cause organ damage over time. 

Understanding how insulin interacts with its receptor is fundamental to the development of novel insulin for the treatment of diabetes.

this is mitochosis perfectionist where medicine makes perfect sense we continue our endocrinology playlist the previous video was the most important one which was the difference between insulin land and glucagon land today it's time to talk about the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase or rtk here's glucose glucose wants to enter into the cell such as skeletal muscle cell or fat cell how does glucose enter you have to open a door for glucose the name of the door is glute4 okay who simulates this door to open insulin which binds to its insulin receptor the receptor tyrosine kinase all of this will start a cascade reaction by which you get this glut4 to open let the glue goes in so that your skeleton muscles and adipose tissue enjoy the time we talked about all of this before today we're talking about receptor tyrosine kinase for insulin and growth factors such as igf-1 fgf pgf and egf insulin-like growth factor 1 fibroblast growth factor platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor growth factors are here but the growth hormone is here big difference quick review of the last video insulin stand versus glucagon stand insulin world has insulin only glucagon world has a glucagon cortisol epinephrine thyroids basically any hormone that's not insulin insulin world is anabolic glucagon world is catabolic insulin is the feeding state glucagon is in the fasting state insulin is pro proteogenesis glycogenesis lipogenesis glucagon stimulates proteolysis gluconeogenesis glycogenolysis lipolysis and ketosis and this was the most important slide ever insulin is one land all the other hormones are in the other hand insulin protein anabolic glycogen anabolic triglyceride anabolic the other hormones such as glucagon thyroxine cortisol epinephrine are protein catabolic glycogen catabolic triglyceride catabolic pause and review charles dickens a tale of two cities midikosis dickens a tale of two hormones it's the land of anabolism it was the land of catabolism it was the age of proteogenesis it was the age of proteolysis it was the epoch of lipogenesis it was the epoch of lipolysis it was the season of glycogenesis was the season of glycogenolysis it was the spring of anti-ketosis it was the winter of ketone bodies here is insulin here is glucagon pause and review insulin is anti-ketogenic insulin promotes dephosphorylation insulin stimulates phosphatases but inhibits kinases insulin decreases cyclic amp when you're fasting this is glucagon land stimulates glycogenolysis break down the glycogen into glucose to use it for energy but when you're feeding its insulin land glycogen synthesis convert that glucose into glycogen and store it when you eat you get glucose and then we have two stories the entrance of glucose into the pancreas to stimulate the beta cell and this is glut2 and then the beta cell of the pancreas gets stimulated to secrete insulin insulin will go to the target cell usually skeletal muscle or adipose tissue and to tell them hey get that glucose in and then you can store it as glycogen or you can use it if you want the door here is good for the first story was discussed in the previous video today we'll talk about the second story but how many causes can we review the first story real quick your wish is my command you ate you have glucose glucose into the cell glucose 6-phosphate because phosphate fixes stuff and this way glucose will never go back to the blood all right glucose 6-phosphate glycolysis more atp more atp will shut this potassium channel potassium will have to stay in a positive inside the cell a positive equals depolarization hashtag activation which opens the calcium channel calcium comes in calcium is the heat of contraction it's going to contract and burst this insulin vessel and then insulin is out look at this insulin c peptide are now in the bloodstream insulin will float in the bloodstream until it reaches adipose tissue and skeletal muscle it will tell them to open their door what's the name of their door glute 4 and when they open the glut4 glucose is going to come inside the fat cell and the skeletal muscle cell we're talking about here now insulin has reached the target what's the target skeletal muscle or fat cell insulin will try to convince them to open their door what's the name of their door glute 4 and when they open their door glucose is going to come in how does this happen insulin has to bind to its receptor the receptor is called receptor tyrosine kinase it has a very good property called autophosphorylation it doesn't need help from anybody it phosphorylates itself it's like nancy ajram a strong independent woman or as the godfather kevin samuels might say quote i'm a strong independent woman i don't need no man unquote such is the life of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation i'm self-sufficient and then i have two pathways the res map kinase pathway and the pi3 kinase it's this pi3 kinase that gets the glut4 out of the vesicle this is basically the doors and then the doors are here in the cell open the door get the glucose in again the door is not just a hole in the wall it's a very complex protein structure what do cancers and insulin have in common both love growth so when i tell you that insulin is going to stimulate something called rest and this res stands for red sarcoma don't be surprised because sarcoma is a cancer that loves growth insulin is also pro-growth so in the next slide many of the things that you will learn about have to do with cancer they also have to do with how insulin works insulin is here trying to act on the target cell what's the target cell the cell is a fat cell or a skeletal muscle cell let's go inside insulin binds to its receptor what's the name of the receptor insulin receptor or receptor tyrosine kinase which has an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity what does kinase do kinase add phosphate hashtag autophosphorylation strong independent i don't need help i am self-sufficient we activate each other you have an alpha subunit and beta subunit we activate each other we don't need help from outside forces there is no need for g protein or gtp we have two alpha subunits and the two beta subunits if you leave them alone alpha wants to inhibit the beta but insulin comes and inhibits the alpha leaving the beta uninhibited it's a story of this inhibition or double inhibition if you leave alpha alone it wants to inhibit the beta insulin comes and inhibits the alpha activating the beta indirectly now we have activation called phosphorylation of what of the irs the organization that takes your money no this is the insulin receptor substrate oh irs insulin receptor substrate when they get phosphorylated they get activated and then you have two stories the story of the res and the story of the pip3 which one is gonna open the gate the pip3 story which one is gonna help the cell grow and multiply it's the rest story so let's first start with the pip3 story the irs was phosphorylated and activated this will phosphorylate and activate pip3 kinase by binding with the ace h2 domain why do they call it sh2 it's the sarcoma homology domain number two sarcoba why because insulin is pro-growth doofus when they first discovered all of this crap they discovered it in rats who had cancer so that's why they named these after cancers the pip3 kinase pathway is active what do kinases do they add phosphate converting the pip2 into pip3 the difference is a phosphate this is active pip3 now is active to do what to activate pdp k1 which will activate pkb which stands for protein kinase b do you remember the story of protein kinase a yeah that was the story of gs coupled receptors such as glucagon so glucagon activates protein kinase a but insulin activates protein kinase b because there is a difference between the insulin land and the glucagon land you activate protein kinase a when you are starving or running from a tiger it's the sympathetic land it's the starvation land but insulin is the land of abundance you stimulate protein kinase b to open the glute fort to get the glucose in because you were just relaxing and you had a beautiful doozy fatty carpi meal such as my double cheeseburger when the protein kinase b is active it lets glucose in how did it happen first i had to synthesize the wood of the door what's that that's glute4 it was in the physical i got it out now the door is open for glucose to come in what will you do with this glucose i can use it or i can make glycogen from it glycogen synthesis this protein kinase b is pro growth and anabolism therefore you get also protein synthesis that's why your cell is gonna grow that's why cancer is gonna grow and this is the story of the mtor which is a huge story in pharmacology i have a course about this on my website and it's called anti-cancer pharmacology course that was the first story which is the pip3 kinase what does pip stand for phosphatidyl inositol triphosphate kinase which converts the phosphatidyl inositol diphosphate or bisphosphate into phosphatidyl inositol triphosphate what does the pdpk stand for it's the phosphatidine dependent protein kinase one phosphate the independent protein kinase add a phosphate and activate this protein kinase b is also known as acts you know when you watch an ad by a freaking lawyer telling you to ask now protein kinase visa i'm gonna act now act to do what to open that glute4 carrier for the glucose to enter to perform glycogen synthesis and protein synthesis thank you so much the second story is the story of the rest after you phosphorylated the irs insulin receptor substrate you will phosphorylate gerb s2 and then you will save our souls by activating sos jtp is going to activate their ass res is going to activate the ref ref is going to activate mech mech is going to activate map k map k is going to activate apk and then apk will cause transcription and increase cell survival sir growth and differentiation which is true whether we're talking about insulin or whether we're talking about cancer and that's why many of our growth factors are involved with cancer such as the platelet-derived growth factor epidermal growth factor all of these growth factors cause growth and cancers proliferate thanks to growth see medicine makes so much sense once you understand what the flip you're talking about what does the gerb 2 stand for it stands for growth factor receptor bound protein because it's going to cause growth what does sos stand for sun of 7 less what is 7 less it's a gene that encodes receptor tyrosine kinase this sos is also known as gef which is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and that's why the next step is guanine triphosphate gtp which activates res red sarcoma why do we call this ref red fibro sarcoma mech is the mitogen signal regulated kinase mapk is the mythogen activated protein kinase erk is the extracellular signal regulated kinase man who named these things now you know how insulin works but how does glucagon work it's the same story of the g-protein-coupled receptor this is protein kinase a because protein kinase b is for the insulin this is how glucagon works this is how epinephrine works pause and review glucagon and the beta stimulation love protein kinase a insulin hates protein kinase a but insulin loves protein kinase b pause and review the key word here is growth or anabolic if you want to learn more about estrogens androgens thyroxine insulin and all of the insulin types

6-95B2TbIh8	UCDCg5AAslixldHh5D7Nu6-g	27.0	Insulin Signalling Pathway | AKT/PI3k Signalling Pathway	"Diabetes Milletus : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUrHTVrqCqQ&t=10s

Type I Diabetes : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkoEw8qeEKU&t=6s

The Insulin binds to a membrane-spanning receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). This glycoprotein is embedded in the cellular membrane and has an extracellular receptor domain, made up of two Œ±-subunits, and an intracellular catalytic domain made up of two Œ≤-subunits. The Œ±-subunits act as insulin receptors and the insulin molecule acts as a ligand. Together, they form a receptor-ligand complex.

Binding of insulin to the Œ±-subunit results in a conformational change of the protein, which activates tyrosine kinase domains on each Œ≤-subunit. The tyrosine kinase activity causes an autophosphorylation of several tyrosine residues in the Œ≤-subunit. The phosphorylation of 3 residues of tyrosine is necessary for the amplification of the kinase activity.[6]

This autophosphorylation triggers the activation of the docking proteins, in this case IRS (1-4) on which Phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase (PI-3K) can be attached or GRB2 where the ras Guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) (also known as SOS) can be attached.

PI-3K causes the phosphorylation of PIP2 to PIP3. This protein acts as a docking site for PDPK1 and Protein kinase B (also known as AKT), which is then phosphorylated by the latter and PK2 to be activated. This leads to crucial metabolic functions such as synthesis of lipids, proteins and glycogen. It also leads to cell survival and cell proliferation. Most importantly, the PI-3K pathway is responsible for the distribution of glucose for important cell functions. For example, the suppression of hepatic glucose synthesis and the activation of glycogen synthesis. Hence, AKT possesses a crucial role in the linkage of the glucose transporter (GLUT4) to the insulin signaling pathway. The activated GLUT4 will translocate to the cell membrane and promotes the transportation of glucose into the intracellular mediumThe insulin transduction pathway is a biochemical pathway by which insulin increases the uptake of glucose into fat and muscle cells and reduces the synthesis of glucose in the liver and hence is involved in maintaining glucose homeostasis. This pathway is also influenced by fed versus fasting states, stress levels, and a variety of other hormones.

When carbohydrates are consumed, digested, and absorbed the pancreas senses the subsequent rise in blood glucose concentration and releases insulin to promote uptake of glucose from the bloodstream. When insulin binds to the insulin receptor, it leads to a cascade of cellular processes that promote the usage or, in some cases, the storage of glucose in the cell. The effects of insulin vary depending on the tissue involved, e.g., insulin is most important in the uptake of glucose by muscle and adipose tissue

This insulin signal transduction pathway is composed of trigger mechanisms (e.g., autophosphorylation mechanisms) that serve as signals throughout the cell."	187000.0	PT4M36S	2d	hd	False		0.0			20800.0	404.0	0.0	25.0	2016-01-19T13:43:35Z	Hussain Biology	22587430.0	in the previous video we discussed about the diabetes mellitus and its types if you want to watch that video first the link is in the description now in this video we'll be discussing about the insulin signaling pathway this pathway regulates blood glucose levels and we know insulin decreases blood glucose levels and it must be noted here it is the glucagon which is the antagonist of insulin and if we see what this pathway does the insulin pathway basically mediates the uptake of glucose molecules from blood where glute4 channels the signaling molecule in this pathway is insulin and the signaling receptor is insulin receptor which is a class of receptor tyrosine kinase molecules and the major important kinase molecule in this pathway is protein kinase b or akt now let's get to the pathway in detail here in this diagram we see we have the plasma membrane of the cell it has got insulin receptor in the form of monomoles embedded in the plasma membrane like we have two monomoles here the insulin receptor monomer has got one beta subunit that gets into the cell through membrane and to it we have extracellular alpha subunit bind as shown in the diagram and we also have pip2 molecule bound to the cell membrane as shown in the diagram now to start a pathway we have insulin molecules present outside of the cell the insulin molecules comes in and binds on the alpha subunit of receptor as shown in the animation this ligand binding or the insulin binding drives the dimerization of insulin receptor as shown in the diagram and from this dimerization we get the intracellular cross phosphorylation of tyrosine domains on beta subunit of receptor now from here the downstream molecules are recruited and activated first of all the irs molecule comes in and binds with activated receptor as shown in the diagram then this activated irs molecule recruits and activates the p85 subunit of pi3 kinase which in turn recruits the p110 subunit of pi3 kinase that is catalytic unit or pi3 kinase so we have now fully activated pi3 kinase and this activated pi3 kinase acts on pip2 and converts it into pip3 as shown in the animation and furthermore this pip3 activates the membrane mount pdk-1 molecule and other kinases now from here we have the inactive pkb or akt molecule so in order to activate the pkb molecule it's first are regulated towards the plasma membrane and here it's acted upon by pdk1 molecule and this pdk-1 molecule phosphorylates the akt3onin residue at 308 which partially activates the akt protein then we also have the pdk2 molecule which phosphates akt and serine 473 residue that completely activates the akt protein now let's keep the activated akt protein here for some time on the other hand we have the glute4 vesicle which needs to be translocated to the plasma membrane for fusion but its translocation is inhibited by as160 protein it inhibits the translocation of skeletal vesicle towards the plasma membrane but once we have akt activated by insulin pathway the akt postulates the as1 c0 at threonine 642 and serene 588 thereby inhibiting its activity so when as1 ck0 is inhibited the glute4 vesicle is easily translocated to the plasma membrane for fusion and we get the glut4 channels in the plasma membrane as shown in the diagram and these channels will then uptake the glucose molecules from blood thereby decreasing the blood glucose levels on the other hand we have the gsk3 molecule it inhibits the glycogen synthesis so we need to inhibit this gsk3 molecule so that glycogen synthesis will go on and here it is done by the akt molecule also the akt molecule emits the gsk3 molecule thus driving the glycogen synthesis again furthermore we see the akt also activates the amp or c1 protein which inhibits the irs protein in a negative feedback loop so in nutshell we see the insulin pathway mediates the uptake of glucose from blood via glut4 channels and also ramps up the glycogen synthesis within the cell so this is all about the insulin signaling pathway i hope you liked the video if you liked it give it a thumbs up do consider support memo on patreon or youtube and make sure to subscribe this channel thanks	High Medical Info

When high levels of glucose enter the blood stream, insulin is released by beta cells in the pancreas. Insulin then initiates a number of signal pathways in specific muscle and fat cells. This takes a look at the signal pathway responsible for allowing those cells to rapidly increase their ability to uptake glucose from the blood stream."	90600.0	PT4M43S	2d	sd	True		0.0			348818.0	1512.0	0.0	55.0	2008-01-30T21:31:48Z	ndsuvirtualcell	25062910.0	Glucose is a good example. Glucose is a critical product of digestion. It is an essential energy source for cellular metabolism. This energy is produced when glucose is used as a substrate for glycolysis and then the Krebs or Citric Acid Cycle. Following the digestion of food, higher levels of glucose circulate through the blood stream where it enters different cell types. In muscle cells glucose is readily used to produce energy and is also stored as glycogen, a secondary short term energy source. In fat cells, glucose is used for Triglyceride production, and acts as an important energy reserve molecule. Here we will illustrate the signaling pathway that occurs when glucose is at high levels. This pathway involves multiple proteins and signaling events. This is termed cytoplasmic signaling.  Different types of cells perform similar signaling steps in response to changes in their environment. In the Protein Recycling animation we see a group of storage vesicles enriched with GLUT4 proteins continuously recycling from the cell membrane to an inactive location in the cytosol. GLUT4 is a protein that facilitates the movement of glucose into the cell. When high levels of glucose are detected by beta cells in the pancreas,  insulin is released by the cells. The insulin circulates through the blood stream until it binds to an insulin receptor embedded in the cell membrane of a muscle, fat, or brain cell. Once the insulin binds to the receptor, phosphate groups are added to the intracellular domain of the receptor. Since the receptor itself adds the phosphate groups, the process is called autophosphorylation. This phosphorylation event sets off a cascade of molecular events. The activated receptor protein then adds a phosphate group to another closely associated protein. This effectively passes the signal from the receptor  to the next step in the signal pathway. Proteins that add phosphate groups to another protein are called kinases. Kinases are often components of signal pathways, and phosphorylation is an important component in the transmission of a signal from one compartment to another. In this system, the signal corresponds to the level of blood glucose and is transmitted from outside to inside the cell. Next we see a large pool of molecules that are embedded in the membrane also being phosphorylated. Other proteins are then in turn phosphorylated, further transmitting the first extracellular signal that was originally sent from outside the cell membrane. So how does this affect the uptake of glucose? As we mentioned before, Glut4 is a glucose transporter, and Glut4 Storage Vesicles are held in a recycling state near the cell membrane. The vesicles are held mostly in this region because the RAB proteins that interact with the motor proteins necessary to move the vesicles to the membrane are in an inactive state. The final step in the signal pathway involves the phosphorylation of a protein that prevents the RAB proteins from interacting with the vesicles. When the RAB proteins are no longer inhibited, the storage vesicles can freely merge with the membrane. Once the vesicles have merged many Glut4 proteins are embedded in the membrane and large quantities of glucose can move into the cell. It is the signaling pathway that insures only the correct molecules will be allowed to enter the target cell.	High Medical Info

from zero finals comm in this video I'm going to be explaining how sglt2 inhibitors work now sglt2 inhibitors are used in type 2 diabetes to help to reduce the blood sugar levels they differ slightly from most anti-diabetic drugs which work by either increasing the insulin in the body or increasing the insulin sensitivity of the cells of the body and the objective of increasing the insulin or the insulin sensitivity is to get the body to take more glucose out of the blood and to store it in the tissues and that's how they reduce blood sugar levels however in sglt2 inhibitors they work slightly differently they work by causing the kidneys to excrete glucose into the urine and by excreting glucose into the urine you reduce the amount of glucose or sugar that's in the blood and the rest of the body for this video I'll give you three examples the first is dapper glyph losen the second is canna glyph losen and the third is MPEG Allah frozen and if you remember these three you're unlikely to come across very many others but the clue is that all of them end with glyph losen there's only one real indication for these medications and that's type 2 diabetes let's go through the mechanism of action firstly in order to understand how sglt2 inhibitors work we need a very basic understanding of the function of the kidneys so let's go through that briefly so to briefly go through those the kidneys made up of about 1 million tiny tubes called nephrons and these nephrons are responsible for filtering and balancing fluid and electrolytes between the blood and the urine now the nephron consists of five main landmarks that you need to be aware of the glomerulus the proximal convoluted tubule the loop of Henle the distal convoluted tubule and the collecting duct and the glomerulus and the convoluted tubules are up in the cortex of the kidney and the loop of Henle and the collecting duct passed down into the medulla of the kidney how it works is water and small molecules are filtered from the blood into what we call the filtrate in the glomerulus and then varying amounts of water and molecules are reabsorbed from the filtrate into the blood along the tubules loop of Henle and collecting ducts and what's left and the filtrate becomes the urine for the purpose of understanding sglt2 inhibitors we're most interested in the proximal tubule glucose is actively reabsorbed in the proximal tubule along with sodium normally glucose is filtered passively into the filtrate in the glomerulus and under normal conditions all of this glucose is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule so you shouldn't find any glucose in the urine where the blood glucose exceeds about ten millimoles per liter then the proximal tubular enough capacity to reabsorb all of it so you'll start to see glucose appearing in the urine let's look a little bit closer at the proximal tibial there are cells that line the proximal tubule that have a molecule called the sodium glucose linked transporter which we shortened to s GL T on their luminal side this transports sodium and glucose together across the cell membrane and out of the filtrate this sodium and glucose then passively diffuses out of the other side of the cell into the interstitial fluid where it's reabsorbed into the blood this sodium glucose linked transporter is a target of the sglt2 inhibitors such as DAPA glyph losen and as the name suggests they inhibit the action of the sglt2 molecule and prevent the glucose that has filtered out of the blood in the glomerulus from being reabsorbed and as a result the glucose is secreted into the urine and the blood glucose stays low because it's not being reabsorbed in the proximal tubule and this is how they reduce blood sugar and reduce the amount of sugar in the body let's look at the side effects so as you would imagine one of the main side effects is glucose area and this is glucose in the urine and that's because this is the main mechanism of action of these medication the second side effect is increased rate of urinary tract infections increasing the amount of sugar in the urine provides a great environment for bugs to grow therefore it does increase the risk of urinary tract infections and Candida infections which we commonly call thrush another side effect is weight loss and this is because when you excrete a lot of glucose in the urine this can cause an osmotic diuresis which means that the high level of glucose and the filtrate draws water into the urine through osmosis so the water is moving from the area of low concentration of solutes into the area of high concentration of solutes meaning a lot of glucose in the urine and this causes the person to lose more glucose in the urine and to lose more water in the urine which leads to frequent urination dehydration low blood pressure and weight loss the final and quite rare complication is diabetic ketoacidosis notably with only moderately raised glucose levels and this is quite a rare complication but it's one that's worth knowing about firstly for your exams and secondly so you can bear it in mind when you start seeing patients who are on these medications so thanks for watching I hope you found this video helpful if you did don't forget there's plenty of other resources on the zero to finals website including loads and loads of notes on various different topics that you might cover in medical school with specially made illustrations there's also a whole test section where you can find loads of questions to test your knowledge and see where you're up to in

disposable insulin pen you may be using any of the insulin pens pictured here insulin pens come in several different styles depending on the type of insulin that you are prescribed the information in this video applies to all disposable insulin pens first let's review the guidelines for storing your insulin pen it is important to not store your pens in warm places such as in the car or in direct sunlight when you fill your prescription at the pharmacy you will receive a box that contains five insulin pens take out one pen and leave it at room temperature for your use do not store opened insulin pens in the refrigerator keep the remaining pens in the refrigerator until you need them unused insulin pens that are stored in the refrigerator are good until the expiration date stamped on the box it is important to make sure that the pens do not freeze once it is open an insulin pen can be used for 10 14 28 or 42 days depending on the type of insulin that it contains this chart shows how long the different types of insulin pens can be used after they are opened and stored at room temperature you should throw away an open pen once it is empty or after it has been opened for longer than what is recommended whichever comes first if you are unsure about how long you can use your pen before it needs to be discarded please check the instructions that come with your pen be sure to always have a spare pen available in case you lose or damage the pen that you are currently using it is helpful to refill your insulin pen prescription before the time that you need it so that you will always have an extra pen available now that you know how to store your insulin let's review the parts of your insulin pen there's the cap the label the dose adjustment dial and the injection button once the cap is removed you will see the needle attachment point and the insulin reservoir window in addition to a prescription for your insulin pen you will also receive a prescription for pen needles from your doctor you will need to use a new pen needle each time you need to inject insulin with your insulin pen now we will review these steps that you should complete for each insulin injection we will go through six main steps the first step is getting everything ready obtain everything that you will need for the injection you will need your insulin pen a couple alcohol swabs or cotton balls moistened with alcohol a new pen needle and a hard plastic or metal container with a lid you should wash your hands with warm water and soap before each injection next look at your insulin pen check the label to make sure that it is the type of insulin that was prescribed to you also check the expiration date on the side of the pen before you give your injection remove the cap of your insulin pen and set it aside you will put it back on your pen once you are finished injecting your insulin it is important to check the insulin window of your pen to make sure that your insulin is safe to inject for most types of insulin such as those shown here the insulin should be clear and not discolored there are some insulins such as the mixed insulins that are supposed to be cloudy and white in appearance make sure you talk with your doctor nurse or pharmacist or track with your insulin pen instructions so that you know what your insulin should look like no matter what type of insulin you are using you should not see any solid particles in your insulin cloudy types of insulin should be mixed before use to mix a cloudy insulin put the pen in a horizontal position and gently roll it between your palms ten times then turn the pen up and down ten times check the insulin window again to make sure the insulin is evenly mixed and appears cloudy white without any clumps remember this mixing step is only necessary if you use a cloudy insulin the second step is attaching your needle to your insulin pen take an alcohol swab or cotton ball moistened with alcohol and wipe the needle attachment point take a new pen needle and remove the protective seal attach the needle to the pen by pushing the needle straight onto the pen then turn the needle in a clockwise fashion until it will not turn anymore remove the outer cap and keep it you will need it again after you are done giving your injection remove the inner cap and throw it away the third step is priming your insulin pen priming your pen is an important step that helps to make sure that there are no air bubbles in your insulin and that you will receive your full dose at the time of your injection to do this turn your dose adjustment dial to two units now turn your insulin pens so that the needle is facing upward tap the insulin window to help any air bubbles move to the top of your pen while keeping the pen facing upward push the injection button all of the way in you should see insulin coming out of the needle tip as you push the injection button if you do not see any insulin come out of the pen needle redial another two units and push the injection button in all the way again if no insulin comes out after three tries attach a new needle and repeat this step the fourth step is selecting your dose turn the dose adjustment dial to the appropriate dose that you need in this example we will be injecting ten units of insulin if you accidently turn the dial too far simply turn it back to the dose that you need the fifth step is injecting your insulin decide where you would like to make your injection you can choose from your upper arm abdomen hip or upper thigh you can use this same general area for each injection but you want to stay at least one inch away from your last injection site any scars and your belly button once you have selected your injection site wipe the area with an alcohol swab make sure to allow the area to dry completely so that the alcohol does not cause your injection to burn gently pinch the area of skin unless your doctor or diabetes educator gave you different instructions and insert the needle at a 45 to 90 degree angle depending on the instructions provided by your doctor or diabetes educator to deliver your dose push the injection button in the whole way keep the injection button pushed in and slowly count to 10 insulin continues to flow out of the needle for up to 10 seconds after you have pushed the injection button now remove the needle from your skin if you bleed at the site of the injection then press down gently on the injection site using the alcohol swab or a piece of gauze do not rub the area the sixth step is disposing of the needle you should dispose of your insulin pen needle in a proper manner after each injection pen needles cannot be reused and insulin pens should not be stored with the pen needle attached put the outer needle cap that you had set aside earlier back on your needle now unscrew the cap and needle by turning them in a counterclockwise fashion the needle will come off with the cap you should dispose of your needle in a sharps container like the one pictured here you can purchase a sharps container from your local pharmacy you can also make your own sharps container by using an empty metal coffee can with a lid or an old laundry detergent bottle label the bottle with the words sharps and do not recycle when the container is full tape the lid down and throw it out in the regular trash now put the cap back on your pen and store it in a safe place until your next injection when you get to the end of the insulin gabor there may not be enough insulin to inject your entire insulin dose if you find that you are unable to turn the dose adjustment dial to the dose you require do not force it your insulin pen is designed to stop you from selecting a dose that is higher than the amount of insulin remaining in your pen for example if you need to inject 50 units of insulin but only 20 units are left in your pen you will not be able to turn the dose adjustment dial past 20 units when this occurs you have two options the first option is that you can inject the amount of insulin that is left in your pen and then use a new pen to inject the remaining amount of your dose your other option is to discard this pen and use a new pen to inject the entire dose that you need now let's review the six main steps that are involved with giving yourself an insulin injection first get everything ready obtain everything you need to make your injection wash your hands and if you have a cloudy insulin then gently mix it second attach the insulin pen needle to the pen third prime your pen fourth select the appropriate dose of insulin that you should inject v in Jack your insulin don't forget to hold down the injection button for at least the count of ten before removing the needle and lastly dispose of your insulin needle in a proper container you by following these steps with each injection you will be successful and confident in your ability to use an insulin pen you	High

For all intents and purposes, yes, Prediabetes is the same as IGT or IFG. They all mean the same thing. At one point it was which test was used as to what the condition was called.  

What you call something is kind of interesting isn‚Äôt it?  Did you know it is now politically incorrect to call someone with diabetes a ‚Äúdiabetic‚Äù?  Now, diabetic medications and diabetic foods are fine. But many people who have diabetes actively resist being labeled as a diabetic, as if we were an illness. A correspondent writes, ‚ÄúWhat I give as an example to doctors and other technical people is: If a person has hemorrhoids, does that make that person one?‚Äù

Now I personally am not offended one bit by the term diabetic if someone refers to me as that.  But I have tried to be very careful in my video series to not use that term when describing people because it does offend some people and that just isn‚Äôt something I want to do.  

But terms in the world of diabetes have been developing and changing over the years. Here are some examples:

What used to be called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is now  referred to as type 1 diabetes. 
The former terms, adult-onset diabetes or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), are now called type 2 diabetes. And there is no such thing as borderline diabetes. If that‚Äôs what you think you have, it is either pre-diabetes or diabetes.

So what was once called Impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose is now pre-diabetes or prediabetes. There is even some controversy over there should be a hyphen.The reason given for this change was to show the seriousness of the condition.  

The latest I have found to be ‚Äúargued‚Äù in the diabetes community is to change the name of prediabetes to Stage 1 Type 2 Diabetes.  As many of you know, many doctors and even insurance companies don‚Äôt recognize prediabetes as diabetes proper.  The movement to change the name to Stage 1 Type 2 Diabetes is starting to gain ground.  

This is one movement I think I could support.  It gives those with prediabetes a more concrete idea of what they truly have.  But, it also gives a sense that just because they have prediabetes, it will definitely become Type 2, which isn‚Äôt true.

Names can change a total outlook on things. But rather than argue over the name of what you have, it is much more important to work on your diet and exercise plan to control that blood sugar or blood glucose.

IGT may precede type 2diabetes mellitus by many years. IGT is also a risk factor for mortality.Criteria  According to the criteria of the WorldHealth Organization and the American Diabetes Association, impaired glucosetolerance is defined as: two-hour glucose levels of 140 to 199 mgper dL on the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. A patient is said to beunder the condition of IGT when he/she has an intermediately raised glucoselevel after 2 hours, but less than the level that would qualify for type 2diabetes mellitus. The fasting glucose may be either normal or mildly elevated.From 10 to 15 percent of adults in the United States have impaired glucosetolerance or impaired fasting glucose. Treatment The risk of progression to diabetes and development of cardiovascular disease isgreater than for impaired fasting glucose.Although some drugs can delay the onset of diabetes, lifestyle modificationsplay a greater role in the prevention of diabetes. Patients identified as havingan IGT should exercise regularly, lose 5 to 7 percent of body weight, and limitintake of sugar and highly processed carbohydrates.See also  Glucose tolerance testImpaired fasting glucose References Further reading  Melanie J Davies, I Peter Gray.""Impaired glucose tolerance"".

from zero to finals comm I'm going to go through some quick things today just about blood glucose regulation and how this relates to type one diabetes and type 2 diabetes so let's get straight into it so I'm going to go ahead and talk about some key organs that are important when looking at the regulation of blood glucose so the first organ is start with is the small intestine this sits in the middle of the abdomen it's where your food is broken down and absorbed into the bloodstream as glucose so anytime you eat carbohydrates this is where it's absorbed into the bloodstream the next important organ to be aware of is the pancreas the pancreas produces insulin in the beta cells and it produces glucagon in the Alpha cells okay the next organ is the liver now the liver is important because it's stores glucose so when there's plenty of glucose around it can store it as glycogen and it can also produce glucose in a process called gluconeogenesis which converts things like amino acids into glucose the final organ is the muscles of the body this is where glucose is absorbed stored as glycogen and can be used at a later time when more glucose is needed so there's a quick overview of the important organs that are involved in glucose metabolism next I want to give a bit of a graphical representation of how these organs affect the blood glucose level so here we've got a diagram along the bottom you can see this is most represent of blood vessel and then this inside is the bloodstream and these little blue hexagons represent glucose molecules so here for example this is just a nice ordinary level of glucose in the blood the body's very happy with this level so let's take a typical scenario where a person eats a large bowl of rice that rice enters the digestive system into the small intestines is broken down into glue and absorbed into the bloodstream okay so now we have as a reaction to all of that new glucose a rise in blood sugar levels so what happens now well the pancreas senses this rise in blood glucose level and it produces a hormone called insulin now what this hormone insulin does is it targets the liver and it's Hargett s' the muscles and it tells them to absorb glucose from the blood into the liver and muscles and store it as something called glycogen and this is a storage molecule for the glucose so as a result of this action the blood sugar level drops back down to normal and everybody's happy so let's take an opposite scenario let's imagine that the blood glucose level is low now this might be because of increased demand for glucose by the body let's say during exercise or during periods of intense thought processes where the brain is using a lot of glucose now what happens here is is the brain senses that the blood glucose is low and it might trigger a hunger response which means that more food will be enter into the small intestine and absorbed as glucose the other thing that will happen is the pancreas will sense this low glucose and it will produce another hormone called glucagon what this glucagon does is it targets the liver and it targets the muscles and from both of these it does the opposite effect of the insulin it causes glycogen to convert into glucose it also tells the liver to produce new glucose and this is a process called gluco neo Genesis so this means new glucose being made and this is where glucose is made from either proteins or other chemicals so what happens if you have a situation of diabetes well there's two types of diabetes first we'll talk about type one diabetes and that's quite simple to explain essentially it's where the pancreas stops being able to produce insulin so as the blood glucose rises to a level of high blood glucose the pancreas can't signal to the liver or muscles to use that glucose so the blood glucose remains high and if the small intestine keeps piling in more and more and more glucose this never gets depleted and the person gets in a state of severe hyperglycemia and as a result several other things happen you end up with a situation of diabetic ketoacidosis and ultimately is not compatible with life so the only treatment for type 1 diabetes is to replace that insulin with a subcutaneous injection of synthetic insulin so that's type 1 diabetes type 2 diabetes is where you have this chronic hyperglycemia from a life of high intake of carbohydrates and what this causes is resistance in the liver and the muscles to the insulin so what you need is so insulin is trying to tell the liver and muscles to take up this glucose but because they're so used to this signal they're so used to the insulin that they become very resistant and you need more and more and more insulin to give the same effect okay so essentially the pancreas produces tons of insulin and the liver and muscles respond less and less to this signal and ultimately what happens is that the pancreas wears itself out and so instead of being a high level of insulin the pancreas stops being able to produce as much insulin and you end up with this situation of low insulin and the end stages of type 2 diabetes with a chronically high level of glucose so that situation of we've been through how insulin is can how blood glucose levels are controlled we've been through what happens in type 1 and been through what happens in type 2 diabetes and this video is really in preparation for more videos that are yet to come about the different types of treatments for type 2 diabetes so keep an eye out for those if you like this video please check out the

Original Article: Pancreatic Beta Cell Dedifferentiation as a Mechanism of Diabetic Beta Cell Failure. 
Talchai et al. Cell, 2012. 150 (6) p. 1223-1234."	16300.0	PT6M24S	2d	sd	True		0.0			6625.0	89.0	0.0	7.0	2012-10-31T01:27:39Z	YourekaScience	1827674.0	This new finding comes from a research articlepublished by the Accili lab at Columbia University in Cell journal in September 2012. It is titled ‚ÄúPancreatic B cell dedifferentiationas a mechanism of diabetic B Cell failure‚Äù. These scientists studied Type 2 diabetes,or insulin resistant diabetes. Type 2 diabetes makes up about 90% of allcases of diabetes. One of the main causes of type 2 diabetesis obesity. Because rates of obesity and type 2 diabeteshave increased substantially over the past 50 years, it is important to understand theunderlying biology at the level of the cell in order to engineer the next generation oftherapeutics. In order to understand Type 2 diabetes, let‚Äôsfocus on the pancreas. The important molecule we are going to talkabout is insulin. When glucose, in the form of sugar or starchis consumed by an individual, insulin is produced in the pancreas by cells called B cells. Insulin causes the cells to take up and storeglucose to reduce glucose levels in the blood. So what happens in type 2 diabetic patients? Well, these patients experience somethingcalled insulin resistance. This happens when the body cannot properlyuse the insulin to store away glucose. As a result, glucose accumulates and the Bcells in the pancreas keep secreting more and more insulin to try and lower the bloodglucose level. This causes a lot of stress on the beta cellsand eventually the patient experiences ‚ÄúBeta cell failure‚Äù where the pancreas is no longerable to produce insulin and blood glucose remains high. This paper addresses this issue of ‚Äúbetacell failure‚Äù and tries to understand WHY beta cells become unable to make insulin. To start talking about this finding, letsunderstand where beta cells come from. Beta cells come from stem cells that we callprogenitor cells that are specialized in producing a variety of cells for the pancreas. What happens is a progenitor cell will divideand those cells will undergo a process called ‚Äúdifferentiation‚Äù where they become betacells that produce insulin. This is a one way street so beta cells cannotmake stem cells. Before this finding came out, there was muchcontroversy in the field trying to understand why beta cells can no longer produce insulin. Some scientists thought that the beta cellsdied more quickly than they were replenished, which caused a net reduction in the numberof cells that produce insulin. What this paper is showing is something alittle different. The authors are using a mouse model of type2 diabetes that develops beta cell failure and type 2 diabetes. What the authors did is they looked at whathappens to the beta cells over time when a mouse experiences beta cell failure. To do this they engineered the mouse so thatall beta cells that made insulin were YELLOW. If a beta cell loses its ability to make insulin,it turns GREEN. So now they are able to answer their question:what causes beta cell failure? If beta cells were dying more quickly thannew cells were being made (as was previously thought), then the number of yellow cellswould go down and there would be no green cells. But that is not what they saw‚Ä¶ In contrast, the authors saw that the numberof GREEN cells was actually going UP with beta cell failure. This means that beta cells were losing theirability to make insulin. The beta cells weren‚Äôt dying at all, butthey were changing into cells that do not produce insulin. What are these new green cells? Well it turns out that these new green cellsare actually progenitor cells! The same progenitor (or stem) cells that normallyproduce beta cells!! The beta cells undergoing beta cell failurehave gone back in time to become the progenitor cells that produced THEM! This process is called ‚Äúde differentiation‚Äùbut it had NEVER before been shown to occur in response to beta cell failure in the pancreas. What‚Äôs even more exciting is that thesegreen de differentiated cells are then able to make a variety of different cells for thepancreas. This finding is very exciting for a numberof reasons: #1- it provides a new understanding of thecauses of type 2 diabetes that was not previously known#2- it suggests that there is no LOSS of cells so these new progenitor cells may still havethe ability to turn BACK into beta cells and reverse beta cell failure to maybe cure type2 diabetes. So what did this study show? This study showed that during beta cell failure,which causes type 2 diabetes, beta cells that normally make insulin de differentiate tobecome the progenitor cells that created them. These new progenitor cells can then produceother cells for the pancreas. This finding is very exciting but when thinkingabout therapies for type 2 diabetes, it is still very preliminary. The authors used a mouse model for type 2diabetes so its not clear if this is also what happens in humans during type 2 diabetesor even in a different mouse model of type 2 diabetes. As you can see, scientists are always tryingto rethink the status quo to gain knowledge and learn the truth about the causes of diseasesto develop more efficient and targeted therapies.

Diabetic kidney disease, or diabetic nephropathy, is kidney disease caused by diabetes. It‚Äôs a very common diabetic complication, affecting about one third of people with diabetes type 1, and half of those with diabetes type 2. Diabetic kidney disease is responsible for most of the excess mortality associated with diabetes.
Because the kidneys remove metabolic wastes, control blood pH, regulate fluid and electrolyte balance, as well as produce several hormones; loss of kidney function results in accumulation of toxic wastes, electrolyte imbalances, and a number of other health problems.
The disease develops slowly over time, progressing from renal insufficiency to end-stage renal failure. Often, initial loss of renal tissue does not produce any symptoms. Symptoms typically appear when a significant portion of kidney function is already lost. The ability to concentrate urine is usually the first to be impaired, resulting in frequent trips to the bathroom, especially at night. Other early signs include fatigue, loss of appetite, and decreased mental ability. 
Chronic high blood glucose levels, together with high blood pressure caused by diabetes, bring damage to tiny blood vessels in the kidneys, affecting their functions. Cellular degeneration in the functional units of the kidneys, the nephrons, in particular the podocytes of renal glomeruli, further contributes to the impairment of renal functions.
Diabetes, especially when poorly managed, is the biggest risk factor for chronic kidney disease. Other risk factors are the same as those for high blood pressure and include smoking, having high cholesterol levels, and being overweight.
Because initial loss of renal tissue does not produce any symptoms, it is important for diabetic patients to test annually for kidney functions. The tests typically include blood and urine analysis.
Prevention and management strategies consist of controlling blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels; all of which can be achieved with a combination of lifestyle changes and medications.
Lifestyle measures typically include a healthy diet with low salt intake, increased physical activity, weight management, and smoking cessation.

juvenile diabetes, is an autoimmune disease that is a form of diabetes in which very little or no insulin is produced by the islets of Langerhans (containing beta cells) in the pancreas.[4] Insulin is a hormone required for the cells to use blood sugar for energy and it helps regulate normal glucose levels in the bloodstream.[2] Before treatment this results in high blood sugar levels in the body.[1] The common symptoms are frequent urination, increased thirst, increased hunger, and weight loss.[4][9] Additional symptoms may include blurry vision, tiredness, and slow wound healing.[2] Symptoms typically develop over a short period of time, often a matter of weeks.[1]

The cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown,[4] but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors.[1] Risk factors include having a family member with the condition.[5] The underlying mechanism involves an autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.[2] Diabetes is diagnosed by testing the level of sugar or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) in the blood.[5][7] Type 1 diabetes can be distinguished from type 2 by testing for the presence of autoantibodies.[5]

There is no known way to prevent type 1 diabetes.[4] Treatment with insulin is required for survival.[1] Insulin therapy is usually given by injection just under the skin but can also be delivered by an insulin pump.[10] A diabetic diet and exercise are important parts of management.[2] If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications.[4] Complications of relatively rapid onset include diabetic ketoacidosis and nonketotic hyperosmolar coma.[5] Long-term complications include heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, foot ulcers and damage to the eyes.[4] Furthermore, since insulin lowers blood sugar levels, complications may arise from low blood sugar if excessive amount of insulin is taken than necessary.[5]

Type 1 diabetes makes up an estimated 5‚Äì10% of all diabetes cases.[8] The number of people affected globally is unknown, although it is estimated that about 80,000 children develop the disease each year.[5] Within the United States the number of people affected is estimated at one to three million.[5][11] Rates of disease vary widely, with approximately one new case per 100,000 per year in East Asia and Latin America and around 30 new cases per 100,000 per year in Scandinavia and Kuwait.[12][13] It typically begins in children and young adults.[1]"	323000.0	PT4M39S	2d	hd	False		0.0			14733.0	220.0	0.0	8.0	2018-01-30T11:45:34Z	Medical Centric	63400264.0	today's topic is juvenile diabetes juvenile diabetes is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin insulin is a hormone that helps transport glucose or sugar into the cells for energy production without the insulin excess glucose or sugar stays in the blood with time the high blood glucose or sugar level in the blood can lead to serious conditions with the eyes kidney nerves heart and teeth juvenile diabetes most commonly occurs in children and young adult but can appear at any age juvenile diabetes is also called insulin dependent diabetes or type 1 diabetes causes in juvenile diabetes the pancreas loses its ability to make insulin because the immune system mistakenly fights and destroys the insulin-producing cell in the pancreas insulin works to move glucose out of the blood into the cells and lower the amount of glucose in the bloodstream without it glucose stays in the blood as they can't get into the cell and builds up in the bloodstream the following can increase your chance of juvenile diabetes family history a child with a parent or sibling that has juvenile diabetes has a higher risk of developing the condition viral infections can trigger the autoimmune process exposure to chemicals especially the one found in plastics symptoms kids and teens who develop juvenile diabetes may have symptoms such as increased thirst frequent urination extreme hunger weight loss blurred vision fatigue and weakness bedwetting in a child who doesn't usually wet the bed during the night vaginal yeast infection in a girl who hasn't started puberty diagnosis and treatment diagnosis can be made by testing blood samples for glucose the blood tests for juvenile diabetes include random plasma glucose test this is the basic screening test for juvenile diabetes a blood sample is taken without regard to when the child's last meal was taken a random test of 11.1 millimoles per liter indicates diabetes hemoglobin or a1c test this test reflects a child's average blood glucose level over a period of two to three months an a1c level that is 6.5 percent or greater indicates diabetes fasting plasma glucose test or fpg this test measures the blood glucose after the child undergoes a fasting overnight a fasting blood glucose level of 7.0 millimoles per liter or higher suggest diabetes a urine test to detect the presence of chemicals that the body makes when you don't have enough insulin treatment treatment implies good diabetes control to minimize symptoms prevent health condition and help your kid lead a normal physical mental emotional and social growth and development to achieve this both parents and kids should aim to keep the blood glucose level as close to normal as possible most people with juvenile diabetes require insulin administration there are different types of insulin and different ways of delivery the types include rapid acting insulin short-acting insulin and intermediate acting insulin long-lasting insulin the insulin delivery options include fine needle and syringe insulin pen and insulin pump depending on your child's age and need the doctor will recommend the types and delivery method that best suits your kid in addition to insulin healthy eating and dieting are needed to reduce sugar intake control blood glucose and help with weight loss your child should focus on foods that are high in nutrition and low in fat and calories such as fruits vegetables and whole grains and healthy proteins such as fish beans encourage your child to engage in the regular physical activity juvenile diabetes does not have a cure and so in order to help your kid live a normal life treatment plan must be strictly followed thank you for watching our video please do not forget to like and share the video also please subscribe to the channel to stay updated on our latest videos	High Medical Info
_BjkmTnY0mM	UCAX9zD2wvQK6ybYGiMiOhqg	27.0	Types of Insulin and How It Works	"In this whiteboard lesson, Dr. Carmen Corder from Health Ed Solutions guides healthcare providers through an engaging lesson on how insulin works. Dr. Corder explains the different types of insulin and covers its onset, peak, and duration. If you're in nursing school or a nurse needing an insulin refresher, this is a great lesson! 

üìå Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that allows the body to use sugar.

üìåTypes of Insulin:

‚úî Rapid-acting Insulin
‚úî Short-acting Insulin
‚úî Intermediate-acting Insulin
‚úî Long-acting Insulin

üìåOnset - when the insulin starts working
üìåPeak - when the insulin has its strongest effects on the blood sugar 
üìåDuration - how long the insulin has its effects on the blood sugar

Here is some more information about Health Ed Solutions:

here with health ed solutions and today's lesson is on insulin don't forget to visit us online at healthedsolutions.com for more free content now let's get started we're going to talk about several different types of insulin the most common types of insulin that you're going to see in practice in the hospital setting and be tested over in this video so let's just talk about these three terms up here at the top so we've got the onset which that is when the insulin kicks in okay that's when it starts working the peak is when the insulin is working the hardest it's kicking in and fighting hyperglycemia at its peak level with the strongest punch and the duration is basically another word for when the insulin is out of the patient's system so we're going to start with the rapid acting insulins and i've got listed under rapid acting the most common ones that you'll see are the list pro and the ass part now you'll see the as part this is the novel log it ends in log that we give most commonly for sliding scale insulin so when you're checking your patient's blood sugar usually it's order acnhs or every six hours and when you're in clinical you're going to check your patients blood sugar before lunch right for that every six hours or achs schedule and if their sugar is high they're going to require sliding scale insulin well most of the hospitals now have moved to using one of the rapid acting types of insulin to cover sliding scale needs so most of the time you'll be giving nova log and that is one of the reasons you'll see that the onset here is within 30 minutes for all of the rapid acting so no later than 30 minutes these insulin start working and kicking in so that is why we can't go in and say check our patients blood sugar at 10 30 and give them their insulin when their lunch trays are not going to be around until say 12 30 okay because the insulin by then it's going to be peaking out so it's going to be working at its most powerful rate within two hours so the onset of your rapid acting your list pro nova log the onset is within 30 minutes so within 30 minutes that insulin is working it is peaking within about two hours so if you give this rapid acting insulin that's what's called rapid acting it is peaking out within two hours so it's packing its full punch in two hours and then within about four hours it's out of the patient's system so the rapid acting is in and out within four to five hours and these are kind of generalizations because when you start trying to remember you know 15 to 30 minutes you know 30 minutes to an hour it gets a little hard to remember but just remember that you're rapid acting or your list pro your novalog as part and the peak really is the most probably important factor that you need to remember that's what you're going to be tested over they're going to ask you things like when would you want to you know make sure that the patient has their food after administering this type of insulin and you obviously want to make sure that they have their food before the insulin is at its peak next we have the short acting and we used to use the short acting or the regular most often but it seems like most the hospitals that i'm working in now have switched over to the rapid acting now the onset for the short acting is within an hour some of them are going to start working within 30 minutes but all of them will be working within one hour of giving that insulin injection it takes a little bit longer for the short acting to peak so within three hours these insulins peak out and then within about eight hours these insulins are out of the patient's system so your rapid and your short acting they do their job and they're out of the system within eight hours all right and that is your novel and r or your regular insulin moving on down to your intermediate acting you can see with the duration between the short acting versus the intermediate there is a huge difference so when you go from short acting to intermediate acting there's a huge difference in the duration of these insulins so nph is your intermediate acting insulin so i think of intermediate nph and it has an onset between one to two hours so it's definitely going to be in the system and working within two hours at the most it peaks out in 10 hours you'll see different ranges some will say 8 to 14 hours but i'm giving you an approximation so within about 10 hours of receiving that insulin at nph it is peaking out at its peak working power if you will and then the duration within about 18 hours it's out of the system so this insulin hangs around for quite some time 18 hours then finally our long acting live amir i remember long-acting live amir but anytime you see an insulin that ends in ir or ear mirror it is a long-acting insulin and this is the type of insulin that you night shift nurses will give at night to protect the patient overnight from hyperglycemia and it again has an onset see all your onsets of your insulins are pretty close they all start working within about the same amount of time the big differences are the peak and duration so within one to two hours the levomir or the detemir is working it doesn't peak for 18 hours and then within about 24 hours it is out of the patient's system so long acting is your levomir it's onset you know again it's not too different than the rest of your insulins the peak is in 18 hours and within 24 it is out of the patient's system that's it for our lesson today thanks for watching and remember to check out our website at healthedsolutions.com

The levels of this C-peptide indicate the rate of synthesis of insulin, so it can be used as an indicator few clinical conditions such as diabetes and insulinomas.	143000.0	PT10M8S	2d	hd	False		0.0			12139.0	209.0	0.0	6.0	2011-10-10T16:58:18Z	egpat	15364722.0	hi everyone in this video today let us discuss c peptide test what is c peptide this is one of the peptide made up of 23 amino acids and this peptide is going to be removed during the synthesis of insulin so c peptide is going to be derived from the synthesis of insulin but it is required for the sins of insulin because during the synthesis and release of insulin this peptide chain should not be misfolded so c-peptide prevents the misfolding of insulin structure and this c-peptide is also required to bring inter-chain diesel failing case between the two chains we know that insulin is anger two chains cheney as well as chain b these two chains are having two interchain disulphide bridges these bridges are formed in prince of c peptide which prevents the misfolding so that disulfide linkage can be formed in order to stabilize the insulin structure in this way c peptide plays an important role in the synthesis of insulin so whenever the c peptide levels are going to be elevated it is associated with the increase since of insulin in this way the sea peptide levels give an indication of turnover of insulin senses so today in this video we are going to discuss what is the significance of c peptide test how it is going to be released what are the normal levels and in which conditions it is elevated and in which conditions it is lower all these things we will discuss in this video insulin is going to be released from the pre-hormones the initial precursor is pre-pro insulin this prepro insulin is having the 110 amino acids which is going to be converted into pro-insulin where the end terminal is going to be removed and now this pro insulin is having 74 amino acids so in this conversion 36 amino acids are going to be deleted by signal transcript edges now this pro insulin is the immediate precursor for the insulin it can be converted into insulin which is mediated by endopaepidases and here around 23 amino acids are going to be deleted to produce insulin with 51 amino acids now these 23 amino acids which are deleted in this last step is nothing but the c peptide so c peptide is going to be deleted where pro insulin is going to be converted into insulin so this is the structure of pre pro insulin it is having the n terminal this n terminal is going to be removed by signal transcriptages by action of these enzymes this n terminal is going to be removed such that the prepro insulin is going to be converted into pro insulin now pro insulin is still having a c-peptide chain which is required for formation of disulfide bridges now in the pro-insulin bridges are formed in prince of c peptide but this c peptide is not required for the insulin structure now another group of enzymes endopedicis can cleave the c peptide at the both of the attachments by the action of this endopeptidase enzyme the c-peptide is going to be removed from the insulin structure in this way pro-insulin can be converted into insulin now both pro-insulin as well as insulin are going to be stored and they can be released by exocytosis so the levels of c-peptide is an indicator of levels of insulin in this way by measuring the c-peptide levels we can assess the insulin levels within the body thereby we can differentiate either typhon or type 2 diabetes in the patients when this test is required one of the important indication of c peptide test is to differentiate whether the patient is having a type 1 diabetes or they're having type 2 diabetes in the type 1 diabetes there is a auto destruction of pancreatic beta cells resulting in the decreased insulin release so in such conditions the sea peptide levels are reduced but in the type 2 diabetes generally the insulin is intact but the insulin is not working properly resulting in the increased insulin resistance in such conditions we can observe some elevated levels of c peptide because of increased levels of insulin during the resistance in this way c peptide test can be used to differentiate python as well as type 2 diabetes in the patients similarly another important condition is the hypoglycemia in which again the c-peptide test can be done in the patients with recurrent hypoglycemia with few of the symptoms such as excessive sweating severe palpitations awareness of heartbeat along with some irregular heartbeat confusion increased appetite and some blurred vision fainting sensation and even it can lead to severe hypoglycemia resulting in convulsions so these symptoms are observed in the patients which occur repeatedly then c-peptide tests can be done in order to assess the insulin levels as well as in order to assess the action of anti-diabetic agents what are the normal values the normal values of c peptide are variable with the laboratory conditions generally the normal range of c peptide is falling in between 0.5 to 2.0 nanogram per ml so whenever the c peptide levels are elevated or reduced it can indicate some abnormality in the patients so the elevated levels of c peptide mainly indicates that patients may have increased release of insulin which may be due to any development of insulin resistance particularly in the type 2 diabetes mellitus insulin resistance is going to be developed where insulin is not working properly so in order to reduce the glucose levels insulin is more released resulting in the increased c peptide levels similarly the patients with insulinomas where excess of insulin is going to be released because of any cancer of beta cells which results in the proliferation and release of more insulin leading to elevated levels of c peptide so a high levels of c peptide may indicate some insulinomas in the patients and during the treatment these c peptide levels are reduced which indicates that the insulinomas are responding to the treatment so c peptide levels are elevated in the patients with insulinomas similarly in other conditions where anti-diabetic cases are used such as sulfonylureas which are increasing the insulin secretion from the beta cells so drugs like glipidide glibe and clamite these are the sulfonylureas they can increase the insulin release so when they are excessively used they can increase the sea peptide levels by promoting the insulin release not only the sulfonal ureas increating mime takes and dpp4 inhibitors all this can increase the insulin release which may elevate the c peptide levels similarly other conditions such as hypokalemia when the potassium levels are reduced otherwise in case of any renal failure or in case of cushing's syndrome where excessive cortisol levels are released in all these conditions insulin senses increased resulting in the increased release of c peptide in this way by elevated sea peptide levels we can assess any of these conditions within the patients when we can observe the low levels of c peptide so again the low levels of c peptide indicate the decreases of insulin this is particularly observed in the patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus where there is destruction of beta cells resulting in the decreased insulin release otherwise in those patients who are administered with excessive exogenous insulin so when the insulin is given by outside and when it is repeatedly administered it can reduce the insulin release by negative feedback mechanisms so that we can observe the decreased levels of c peptide finally in the patients with addison's disease where there is decreased cortisol levels again reduce the insulin synthesis resulting in the decreased levels of c peptide not only these conditions in the patients with any liver failure again results in the decreased peptide levels so whenever the c peptide levels are reduced it indicate any of these conditions similarly the patients who are undergoing the treatment for insulinomas the c peptide levels are gradually reduced which indicates the patient is responding to the treatment in this way the c peptide levels can be tested in order to assess many conditions when they are elevated particularly they indicate increased release of insulin which is associated with type 2 diabetes otherwise with the development of insulin resistance or insulinomas are associated with drug usage such as sulfonylureas ingredients dpp4 inhibitors are few of the metabolic conditions like hypokalemia renal failure or cushing's syndrome in all these conditions we can observe increased levels of c peptide similarly lowering of c peptide levels can be observed in the conditions such as type 1 diabetes administration of exogenous insulin or in the conditions such as adsense disease in all these conditions we can observe the decreased levels of c peptide so that's about the significance of c peptide test hope you have enjoyed this video if you like this video please subscribe to our channel

disorder that involves damage to multiple peripheral nerve fibers with the distal nerves usually affected most predominantly and so the classical presentation is a symmetric distal burning or loss of sensation common causes include alcohol and diabetes and then you have rare causes such as charcoal mary tooth disease the body's nervous system is divided into the central and peripheral nervous system the central nervous system is our brain and spinal cord the peripheral nervous system is a division of the nervous system that contains all the nerves outside the central nervous system its main function is to connect the central nervous system with the organs the limbs and the skin your peripheral nerve fibers come in different sizes from largest to smallest you have the motor nerves which are myelinated sensory nerves which can be myelinated or unmyelinated and then you have the autonomic nerves which are usually the smallest and are unmyelinated or lightly myelinated myelinated nerve fibers means that they contain or are surrounded by myelin sheath myelin allows for rapid transfer of signals rapid conduction unmyelinated fibers are slower the peripheral nerves are not as well protected as the central nervous system and are susceptible to a variety of toxic inflammatory hereditary infectious things that can lead to polyneuropathy polyneuropathy can affect the peripheral motor nerve fibers the sensory nerve fibers or both as well as the autonomic nerve fibers there are two patterns of injury in peripheral neuropathy or polyneuropathy and these are axonal loss or demyelination axonal loss implies that there are less number of neurons because they are damaged and as a consequence the nerve fiber will send a weaker signal demyelination means loss of myelin and as we know myelinated neurons allow for faster signals therefore demyelination causes slowing of signals these two patterns of injury differ in clinical presentation polyneuropathy can affect motor sensory or autonomic nerve fibers axonal polyneuropathy affects the longer nerve fibers first starting distally and then progresses proximally it affects sensory nerve fibers before the motor nerve fibers the longer nerve fibers are the ones that supply your legs the hands are affected once the neuropathy is above the knees typically now the majority of polyneuropathy is axonal sensory nerve injury causes symmetrical numbness burning sensation pins and needles of the distal lower limbs this will progressively ascend up the lower limbs and affect feet before hands eventually the motor nerve fibers are also affected causing weakness and atrophy clinically you also get a reduced deep tendon reflex in demyelinating injury typically the large nerve fibers are affected first which are your motor nerves and this will present with weakness more than sensory changes eventually however most patients will complain of sensory changes polyneuropathy is a disorder that involves damage to multiple peripheral nerve fibers differential diagnosis for polyneuropathy include other peripheral neuropathies these include radiculopathy which is injury or damage to the nerve root and this causes sensation deficit in a specific dermatomal pattern and weakness in a specific myotome there's also plexopathy which is damaged to a nerve plexus such as a brachial plexus a type of peripheral neuropathy is also a mononeuropathy which is damaged to a single peripheral nerve such as in carpal tunnel syndrome another differential is monouridis multiplex which is damaged to multiple nerves in an asymmetrical distribution so for example in carpal tunnel as well as if someone has a foot drop the causes of polyneuropathy can be divided based on the mechanism of injury we we talked about axonal loss or demyelination axonal loss is the most common cause of polyneuropathy and include the two most important causes diabetes and alcoholism other causes include chemotherapy hypothyroidism vitamin b12 deficiency hiv infection other rare causes include uremic polyneuropathy paraprotinemia critical illness polyneuropathy and paraneoplastic demyelination is a rare cause of polyneuropathy and these include guillain-barre syndrome chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and charcoal mary tooth disease guillain-barre is an acute peripheral demyelinating condition which also has an axonal variant it is associated with a past capital bacteria infection viral infection as well as vaccination it causes a symmetrical ascending weakness can also affect the respiratory muscles diagnosis is with a lumbar puncture which shows elevated proteins and it is treated urgently with intravenous immunoglobulins while guillain-barre syndrome is an acute form and often patients do recover from this demyelinating disease they could progress and develop chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy chronic inflammatory demanding polyneuropathy is different because it's chronic and usually slow slowly progressive patients eventually are wheelchair bound or bed bound charcoal mary tooth disease is a hereditary sensory motor polyneuropathy which also has an axonal variant there is a gene duplication of pnp and chromosome 17. classic features of charcoal mary tooth include symmetric distal sensory and motor polyneuropathy pescavis hammertoe foot drop calf muscle atrophy with an inverted champagne bottle appearance and hand muscle wasting investigations for polyneuropathy includes performing blood tests and specific tests for all the differential diagnoses we talked about but ultimately a nerve conduction study is used to determine whether the polyneuropathy is due to an axonal or demyelinating injury axonal loss implies that there are less number of neurons because they are damaged this causes a weaker signal to be sent and manifests as a reduction in amplitude on the nerve conduction study demyelination means loss of myelin and as we know myelinated neurons allow for faster signals conduction therefore demyelination causes slowing or a reduced velocity on nerve conduction study so in summary polyneuropathy can be divided into either axonal loss or demyelinating and there are many differential diagnoses but an axonal loss is more common and is due to diabetes and alcohol most commonly the gold standard investigation would be a nerve conduction study and then further investigations to determine the actual etiology thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed this video [Music] [Music] you	High Medical Info

These drugs act on nuclear PPAR receptors, which dimerise with RXR receptors, and affect the transcription of certain genes. These include the increased transcription of anti-diabetic genes, for example, those which code for transporter proteins which increase fatty acid and glucose uptake into cells. This causes a reduction in blood glucose concentration. Drugs in this class include Pioglitazone.

Diabetic ketoacidosis, DKA, is an ACUTE and potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus. DKA is commonly associated with type 1 but type 2 diabetics are also susceptible. DKA is caused by a critically LOW INSULIN level and is usually triggered when diabetic patients undergo further STRESS, such as infections, inadequate insulin administration, or cardiovascular diseases. It may also occur as the FIRST presentation of diabetes in people who did NOT know they had diabetes and therefore did NOT have insulin treatment. 
Glucose is the MAJOR energy source of the body. It comes from digestion of carbohydrates and is carried by the bloodstream to various organs. Insulin is a hormone produced by beta-cells of the pancreas and is responsible for DRIVING glucose INTO cells. When insulin is DEFICIENT, glucose can NOT enter the cells; it stays in the blood, causing HIGH blood sugar levels while the cells are STARVED. In response to this metabolic starvation, the body INcreases the levels of counter-regulatory hormones. These hormones have 2 major effects that are responsible for clinical presentation of DKA:
- First, they produce MORE glucose in an attempt to supply energy to the cells. This is done by breaking down glycogen into glucose, and synthesizing glucose from NON-carbohydrate substrates such as proteins and lipids. However, as the cells CANNOT use glucose, this response ONLY results in MORE sugar in the blood. As blood sugar level EXCEEDS the ability of the kidneys to reabsorb, it overflows into urine, taking water and electrolytes along with it in a process known as OSMOTIC DIURESIS. This results in large volumes of urine, dehydration and excessive thirst.
- Second, they activate lipolysis and fatty acid metabolism for ALTERNATIVE fuel. In the liver, metabolism of fatty acids as an alternative energy source produces KETONE bodies. One of these is acetone, a volatile substance that gives DKA patient‚Äôs breath a characteristic SWEET smell. Ketone bodies, unlike fatty acids, can cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore can serve as fuel for the brain during glucose starvation. They are, however, ACIDIC, and when produced in LARGE amounts, overwhelm the buffering capacity of blood plasma, resulting in metabolic ACIDOSIS. As the body tries to reduce blood acidity by EXHALING MORE carbon dioxide, a deep and labored breathing, known as Kussmaul breathing may result. Another compensation mechanism for high acidity MOVES hydrogen ions INTO cells in exchange for potassium. This leads to INcreased potassium levels in the blood; but as potassium is constantly excreted in urine during osmotic diuresis, the overall potassium level in the body is eventually depleted. A blood test MAY indicate too much potassium, or hyperkalemia, but once INSULIN treatment starts, potassium moves BACK into cells and hypokalemia may result instead. For this reason, blood potassium level is monitored throughout treatment and potassium replacement is usually required together with intravenous fluid and insulin as primary treatment for DKA."	1070000.0	PT3M59S	2d	sd	True		0.0			299445.0	5839.0	0.0	101.0	2014-01-02T04:50:59Z	Alila Medical Media	142574106.0	Diabetic ketoacidosis, DKA, is an acute and¬†potentially life-threatening complication of¬†¬† diabetes mellitus.

Wm3hkZpGDoY	UCEkpVCz0Ixe3G2zcGVHdOsQ	27.0	Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT/GTT) - Indications, Preparation, Interpretation Of Results	"Glucose tolerance test is used to evaluate the ability to regulate glucose metabolism and is indicated when the random or fasting blood glucose testing alone is not sufficient to establish or rule out the diagnosis of diabetes. 
Plasma glucose levels reflect a combination of carbohydrate uptake from the gastrointestinal tract, glucose output from the liver, and glucose uptake from the peripheral tissues. Glucose tolerance test is indicated when the serum glucose level alone is not sufficient to establish or exclude the diagnosis of diabetes. In addition, it is used to screen for gestational diabetes at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation in all pregnant women with no history of diabetes, to screen for diabetes mellitus at 6 to 12 weeks post-partum in women with a history of gestational diabetes, and to screen for impaired glucose tolerance, which is associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus. 
For 3 days preceding the test, person should have a diet containing approximately 150 carbohydrates daily. Before the test, person should fast overnight for a minimum of 8 hours and a maximum of 16 hours. The test is usually performed in the morning and should be seated throughout the test. Baseline fasting glucose is measured before the test. The person is given a 75g oral glucose load. Very rarely, it may e given intravenously. In the standard test, plasma glucose level is measured after 2 hours of glucose load. However, in gestational diabetes, additional measurement is taken after one hour of the glucose load. 
Cut of values for type 2 diabetes include the following. Blood glucose level less than 140 mg per deciliter is considered normal. Blood glucose level between 140 to 199 mg per deciliter is considered prediabetes. And blood glucose level more than 200 mg per deciliter is considered to be having diabetes. A diagnosis of gestational diabetes can be made if one of the following criteria are made. Blood glucose level equal to or more than 180 mg per deciliter after one hour following the oral glucose load, or blood glucose level equal to or more than 153 mg per deciliter after 2 hours following the oral glucose load.

Diabetic ketoacidosis, DKA, is an ACUTE and potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus. DKA is commonly associated with type 1 but type 2 diabetics are also susceptible. DKA is caused by a critically LOW INSULIN level and is usually triggered when diabetic patients undergo further STRESS, such as infections, inadequate insulin administration, or cardiovascular diseases. It may also occur as the FIRST presentation of diabetes in people who did NOT know they had diabetes and therefore did NOT have insulin treatment. 
Glucose is the MAJOR energy source of the body. It comes from digestion of carbohydrates and is carried by the bloodstream to various organs. Insulin is a hormone produced by beta-cells of the pancreas and is responsible for DRIVING glucose INTO cells. When insulin is DEFICIENT, glucose can NOT enter the cells; it stays in the blood, causing HIGH blood sugar levels while the cells are STARVED. In response to this metabolic starvation, the body INcreases the levels of counter-regulatory hormones. These hormones have 2 major effects that are responsible for clinical presentation of DKA:
- First, they produce MORE glucose in an attempt to supply energy to the cells. This is done by breaking down glycogen into glucose, and synthesizing glucose from NON-carbohydrate substrates such as proteins and lipids. However, as the cells CANNOT use glucose, this response ONLY results in MORE sugar in the blood. As blood sugar level EXCEEDS the ability of the kidneys to reabsorb, it overflows into urine, taking water and electrolytes along with it in a process known as OSMOTIC DIURESIS. This results in large volumes of urine, dehydration and excessive thirst.
- Second, they activate lipolysis and fatty acid metabolism for ALTERNATIVE fuel. In the liver, metabolism of fatty acids as an alternative energy source produces KETONE bodies. One of these is acetone, a volatile substance that gives DKA patient‚Äôs breath a characteristic SWEET smell. Ketone bodies, unlike fatty acids, can cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore can serve as fuel for the brain during glucose starvation. They are, however, ACIDIC, and when produced in LARGE amounts, overwhelm the buffering capacity of blood plasma, resulting in metabolic ACIDOSIS. As the body tries to reduce blood acidity by EXHALING MORE carbon dioxide, a deep and labored breathing, known as Kussmaul breathing may result. Another compensation mechanism for high acidity MOVES hydrogen ions INTO cells in exchange for potassium. This leads to INcreased potassium levels in the blood; but as potassium is constantly excreted in urine during osmotic diuresis, the overall potassium level in the body is eventually depleted. A blood test MAY indicate too much potassium, or hyperkalemia, but once INSULIN treatment starts, potassium moves BACK into cells and hypokalemia may result instead. For this reason, blood potassium level is monitored throughout treatment and potassium replacement is usually required together with intravenous fluid and insulin as primary treatment for DKA."	1070000.0	PT3M59S	2d	sd	True		0.0			299445.0	5839.0	0.0	101.0	2014-01-02T04:50:59Z	Alila Medical Media	142574106.0	Diabetic ketoacidosis, DKA, is an acute and¬†potentially life-threatening complication of¬†¬† diabetes mellitus.

It'ssomething you're going to manage mostly with insulin, a hormone your body doesn'tproduce when you have Type 1 diabetes. By now you probably know how and when togive yourself insulin. And if you have an insulin pump you probably know how tomaintain it. But do you know how to tell if something's not working? That's whatwe'll be looking at. You eat carbohydrates to fuel yourself with energy.Your body breaks down the carbs into sugar, which then goes into yourblood. Think about it like filling up the gas tank in a car. When you eat, yourbody stores the carbs to use as energy when you need it later, like filling upthe gas tank. Insulin is what opens the tank to let the gas in. As someone withType 1 diabetes, you don't produce insulin naturally, so the sugar doesn'tget to where it's supposed to be, which is why you take insulin. If you're not getting the insulin you need, the sugar you eat stays in your bloodinstead of being stored in the tank. When this happens, your body won't have thefuel it needs when it needs it, and your body will seek out alternative sourcesto break down into fuel. One of the first sources it looks for isfat. Except when your body breaks down fat, it leaves ketones in yourbloodstream that make your blood acidic. Together with high blood sugar, acidicblood from the ketones can make you sick and put your body in a state of diabeticketoacidosis, or DKA, and DKA is really really serious. It can even be fatal. Themost common reasons for DKA happening are, developing Type 1 diabetes, missingtaking your insulin, getting an infection, and malfunctioning equipment. Your body will give you plenty of pre-DKAwarning signs before you're in serious danger.You may pee more than usual, which is your body getting rid of the sugar thatisn't making its way into yourself. You may feel thirstier than usual, which isyour body diluting the unused sugar in your bloodstream with water. You may findyourself breathing faster, which is the way your body tries to compensate foracidic blood. And you may feel tired and weak. If you notice any of these warningsigns, check your blood sugar, and also check your blood or urine for ketones.If you are worried, or you're not sure what to do, call your diabetes care team or goto the hospital. Remember these easy steps to prevent DKA:- test your blood sugar regularly - always take your insulin, even when you're sick -  If you are sick, stay hydrated,and you may need to take more insulin than normal - if you wear a pump, check regularly to make sureit is connected and working - and if you notice any of the DKA symptomscheck your blood or urine for ketones.

about diabetic ketoacidosis this is an introduction and overview it is important to know that diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency especially in type 1 diabetic patients but it is known that it can also occur in type 2 diabetes as the name suggests it has to do with acidity so there's increase in acidity in the blood essentially the signs and symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis is nausea vomiting polyuria polydipsia weight loss hyperventilation known as kuzmin's breathing now diabetic ketoacidosis doesn't occur out of the blue there's usually some triggers and these triggers these etiology it can be remembered as the five eyes the five eyes are infection intoxication inappropriate withdrawal of insulin in function and intercurrent illness and these five triggers they cause what we know as diabetic ketoacidosis so let's go into the pathophysiology briefly if you want to know more about the functions of insulin watch a video I have on the Fed state which is under biochemistry anyways the pancreas normally produces insulin however in diabetes type 1 there is an autoimmune attack on the B cells which normally produce insulin and therefore insulin is not being produced anymore so we have a decrease in insulin insulin is an important hormone and because we have a decrease in insulin this causes some problems first it means that there it means that gluconeogenesis is not inhibited and so we get gluconeogenesis we get more production of glucose we also get increased glycogenolysis and we get a decrease in like alysus all of which will result in more glucose in the blood so we get hyperglycemia hyperglycemia results in glucose being peed out so we get glucose urea glucose draws water so we get polyuria and we also get dehydration as a result because we lose a lot of water and we are dehydrated we get polydipsia we get thirsty it's also important to note that the decrease in insulin the absence of insulin means that fat breakdown occurs it's a very important concept to understand fat breakdown occurs especially if the body is not receiving enough energy so in in periods of infection or feeling ill the body will start breaking down the fat because glucose is not present and because glucose is not being taken up fats often gets broken down from adipose tissue to form free fatty acids which then go to the liver and undergo ketogenesis to make more ketone bodies it does this because the body needs some form of energy some form of supply because glucose is not working or because glucose is not present with so much ketones being made we get ketone emia we get high ketones in the blood and then subsequently this means that we get ketonuria we are peeing out ketones and it's also important to know that ketones are acidic ketones are acids and so they reduce the pH in the blood but also they will reduce the pH in urine this is the main path of his we see in DKA so if a person presents with the signs and symptoms we spoke of a thorough history and examination needs to be done and appropriate management needs to be performed which includes in the Airways checking breathing and circulation in circulation IV access is important for a few reasons first to get Bloods for investigation it's also important here to get a base serum potassium level after getting the Bloods for investigation administering IV fluids say line and also administration of insulin slowly is very important administration of insulin is important because we want the cells in the body to take up the glucose that is in the blood while this is going on investigations have to be performed so a B G which is arterial blood gas is very important to measure the pH in the blood and this needs to be done regularly Bloods as we mentioned full blood count EU C's for infections and also electrolyte abnormalities and dehydration urine analysis is important to check and monitor if there's glucose ketones and infections ECG is performed to check for arrhythmias in case of potassium hyper Colima or hypokalemia so again monitoring pH by doing regular arterial blood gas is important and also it is important to monitor serum potassium levels the reason it is important to measure seer potassium levels is insulin is being administered because insulin will actually cause hypokalemia if you get hypokalemia you can actually trigger an arrhythmia sometimes calcium gluconate can be administered to protect the heart from these hypokalemia induced arrhythmias anyways monitoring is continuous check pH and check Bloods after a while you can switch the fluids to 0.5% saline and 5% dextrose this is done when blood glucose goes down at least about 14 millimoles per liter elisa say again for diabetic ketoacidosis monitoring is essentials monitor Bloods EU C's perform ABG's to check for pH and monitor urine output and also the changes in urine pH glucose and ketones	High Medical Info

My name is Dr. Lee-Shing Chang. And I'm an associate physicianand endocrinologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital inBoston, Massachusetts. In this video, we'll be talkingabout GLP-1 receptor agonists and their use in weight loss. Key takeaway pointsfrom this video are to understand themajor trials establishing GLP-1 receptor agonists'efficacy for weight loss. When thinking aboutweight management, there are fivemedications that have been FDA approved for long-termweight management as of 2021. Of these agents, orlistat worksby decreasing the digestion and absorption offats at the level of the gastrointestinal tract. The other agentswork in large part by regulatingappetite at the level of the central nervous system. Two of them, liraglutideand semaglutide, are GLP-1 receptor agonists. We'll focus on these twoagents in this video. Of note, there are multipleother GLP-1 receptor agonists that are availablefor use, all of which are associated with weight loss. However, only two,liraglutide and semaglutide, have specific FDA indicationsfor long-term weight management. GLP-1 stands forGlucagon-Like Peptide 1. GLP-1 is an incretin hormoneproduced by the L cells in the intestine inresponse to food intake. GLP-1 has multiple effects. And GLP-1 receptors arefound throughout the body, including in the brain,the gastrointestinal tract, the pancreas, and other organs. GLP-1 has numerous actions. From a weight loss andmetabolic perspective, the most relevant actionsare that it helps regulate appetite and lower glucose. GLP-1 is thought to actat the hypothalamus, regulating appetiteby increasing satiety. GLP-1 also acts on the gut toslow gastrointestinal motility and to increase satiety. And it also acts on the pancreasto upregulate insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. Liraglutide andsemaglutide share over 90% homology to native GLP-1. Both liraglutideand semaglutide have been modified toirreversibly bind to serum albumin in the body. This increases their half-life. Both liraglutide andsemaglutide were initially approved as glucose-loweringmedications for use in type II diabetes. However, both have been foundto induce significant weight loss in many individuals. Dedicated trials in individualswith overweight and obesity without type 2 diabetes haveconfirmed their efficacy for weight loss innondiabetic populations. The SCALE trial establishedliraglutide's efficacy in weight management. It was a double-blind,randomized controlled trial comparing liraglutide at adose of 3.0 milligrams given subcutaneously oncea day to placebo in just over 3,700 patientswithout type 2 diabetes and with a BMI either of atleast 30 or of at least 27 with concurrent dyslipidemiaor hypertension. Both groups also receivedlifestyle modification counseling. After 56 weeks, patientsin the liraglutide group lost a mean of 8.0%,or 8.4 kilograms, of their body weight, comparedto 2.6%, or 2.8 kilograms, in the placebo group. The STEP trials area series of trials to study semaglutide'sefficacy in weight management. STEP 1 was a double-blind,randomized controlled trial comparing semaglutide 2.4milligrams once weekly given subcutaneously to placebo. It enrolled justunder 2,000 patients without type 2 diabetesand, similarly, with a BMI of at least30 or of at least 27 with at least one weight-relatedcoexisting condition. Both groups receivedlifestyle intervention. After 68 weeks, patientsin the semaglutide group lost a mean of 14.9%of their body weight, compared to 2.4% inthe placebo group, for an estimated treatmentdifference of 12.4%. More participants inthe semaglutide group than in the placebogroup achieved weight reductions of 5%, 10%,and 15% or more at week 68. For example, for weightreductions of at least 5%, the comparison was 86% in thesemaglutide group versus 32% in the placebo group. And 51% of participantsin the semaglutide group lost 15% or more weight,compared to only 5% in the placebo group,the takeaway point being significant weight reductionwas seen with use of semaglutide once weekly. If you're wondering whetherliraglutide or semaglutide is more effective for weightloss, the STEP 8 trial helped to answer that question. The STEP 8 trialrandomized 338 participants to semaglutide with matchingplacebo or liraglutide with matching placebo. Participants didnot have diabetes and had a BMI of at least30 or of at least 27 with at least one weight-relatedcoexisting condition. After 68 weeks,the primary outcome showed significantly greaterweight loss with semaglutide compared to liraglutide. The mean weightchange from baseline was 15.8% with semaglutide,versus 6.4% with liraglutide, for a treatmentdifference of 9.4%. An important note is thatcontinued use of GLP-1 receptor agonists is needed to supportmaintenance of weight loss. In the STEP 4 trial, aftersemaglutide run-in period of 20 weeks, participantswere randomized to either switch to placeboor to continue semaglutide. As you can see here, thosewho switched to placebo saw a regain in weight,compared to those who continued semaglutide,who continued to lose weight with continuing semaglutide.

Video Summary:
GLP-1 receptor agonists are basically GLP-1 analogs resistant to degradation by DPP-4. They directly stimulate the GLP-1 receptor and cause insulin release. DPP-4 inhibitors, on the other hand, prevent the degradation of endogenous GLP-1. So the effect of GLP-1 on Œ≤ cells is increased and again, more insulin is released

Both the groups are used in diabetes. We will be studying them together because although their direct targets are different, they both ultimately affect the same system, that is incretins. So let's see the physiology of incretins first. Incretins are released from gut after taking food. They include glucagon like peptide-1 or GLP-1 and glucose dependent insulinotrophic peptide or GIP. GIP has poor action in diabetes, so we will ignore it in this discussion. GLP-1 acts on GLP-1 receptor found on Œ≤ cells of pancreas. This GLP-1 receptor is Gs protein coupled receptor. It's stimulation causes activation of adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase coverts ATP into cyclic AMP. Increased cAMP causes release of insulin. This insulin takes care of glucose that came with the food. Finally, the GLP-1 is degraded by enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 found on the vascular endothelium. So this was physiology. In diabetes, insulin activity is decreased. But now we know that stimulating GLP-1 receptor causes insulin release. So we can target this receptor to treat diabetes. One obvious option could be GLP-1 itself. However, GLP-1 is rapidly inactivated by dipeptidyl peptidase 4 and it's plasma half life is only 1-2 minutes. So native GLP-1 itself cannot be used therapeutically. There are two solutions to this problem. One is GLP-1 analogues which are resistant to degradation by DPP-4 and second is DPP-4 inhibitors. Let's see GLP-1 receptor agonists first. Drugs in this group are exenatide, liraglutide, albiglutide and dulaglutide. They are resistant to degradation by DPP-4. So they stay longer in the body. Like GLP-1 they directly stimulate GLP-1 receptors. The drama inside the cells is essentially the same; activation of adenylyl cyclase, formation of cAMP and release of insulin. Thus, GLP-1 receptor agonists increase release of insulin by directly activating GLP-1 receptors. Now let's see DPP-4 inhibitors. Drugs in this group are sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, alogliptin, tenegliptin and vildagliptin. This drugs inhibit DPP-4. So endogenously secreted GLP-1 is not degraded. So it's effect on Œ≤ cells is increased and more insulin is released. Thus, DPP-4 inhibitors increase the effect of endogenous GLP-1. Quick summary. GLP-1 receptor agonists are basically GLP-1 analogues resistant to degradation by DPP-4. They directly stimulate the GLP-1 receptor and cause insulin release. DPP-4 inhibitors on the other hand, prevents degradation of endogenous GLP-1. So effect of GLP-1 on Œ≤ cells is increased and again, more insulin is released. I hope this clarifies mechanism of action of GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors. That's it for this video.

acne series if you haven't seen 1 & 2 I'll leave them listed down below but this whole week we're doing videos Monday to Friday all about PCOS and acne and today's all about hive Ang's it you can never say that word how about androgen ism which is all about how to blow your testosterone levels which is such a key thing when it comes to acne in general so excited about this video today so hyperandrogenism high testosterone high male sex hormones in the body so let's first stop think about a male because they're dominant hormone is testosterone so what is that causing in their body well that causes them to grow their facial beard which makes sense because when you think about us having like women having testosterone levels which are high but you can see women can get hirsutism which is basically you get hair growing in places like a like a male pattern hair growth basically but testosterone in males like for example when a man is going through puberty and he is starting to you know grow his facial hair and all that kind of stuff you do notice they do sometimes tend to get a lot more acne because their testosterone levels are really peaking so that skin becomes more oily and they can get you know teenage acne and then it will see later in life it starts to regulate out but now let's look at a woman are dominant hormone is usually issued in so when we have testosterone which is high that's why like I said we can get hirsutism which is that male pattern hair growth we can get oily skin which contributes towards acne and when we have excess sebum coming out of our skin that is like a breeding ground for acne because our pausing it blocked we can get information in our poop it causes us to break out and have spots it's a real key player and the tips on we talked about in this video I'm not only just going to help you with acne but if you ask my watch is videon you do suffer with maybe gain either the odd hair or if you do suffer with a bit of hirsutism and male pattern hair growth then this will also help you as well because at the end of the day it still always comes down to the testosterone and hyper engine ISM causing that let's kick it off of my favorite before we get into fact the standard things that diet and all that kind of stuff but let's talk about stability because hello let's talk about spirity because this is in my opinion the most effective way to reduce excess testosterone speaking of spearmint Tic Tac chew aliy have a cup next to me I drink it all the time because I just find but not only does it help with testosterone but it just keeps all my hormones really in check and balance to be honest of you I've tried so many different things to lower testosterone but nothing works quite as effectively as this now diet does play a huge role so let's talk about that notes because I mean my diet is pretty clean anyway that's why spearmint tea makes the biggest impact me but let's just say for example you haven't got the cleanest of diet eating a lot of processed food and sugar then that's the first thing you're gonna want to switch because processed food sugar and just anything that you know in your head you're like yeah it's not really healthy for me that fried foods what kind of stuff it's not and that boost testosterone levels so that is just going to cause the acne and sugar it is a huge one I know we spoke about this in the into the resistance video the last video but again with testosterone sugars not going to do any favors so just try and get it out another thing that you really want to keep in check is your stress levels that has a big impact with testosterone levels as well you know maybe doing a bit of meditation a bit of yoga I know it's like kind of easier said than done I do get that but even if it's just taking five minutes just to like breathe properly and just like you know pay attention to that can really help you as well and also stress doesn't even just have to be breathing and yoga like stress can also come with like maybe taking like a bit of time out and evening to have a bar or maybe reading a book or maybe even actually just watching a TV show that kind of just takes your mind away and just you know makes you not focus on the things that are really stressing you out popping on a bit I love Ireland I know am I really recommending that I mean I do love about a lot of island I mean it's probably not the best thing for me to say like recommend you guys to be watching TV and like work and stuff but I do think that if that is going to lower your stress levels but that's healthy and another thing is sleep I mean sleep the stress kind of go hand in hand so even if it is just taking the time to look after yourself to think do you know what I'm going to bed really too late every single now I'm gonna try and bring it forward make sure I get enough sleep that's also going to help your stress levels as well I also like bouncing off of that let's talk about caffeine and like stimuli and even alcohol caffeine in it stimulants like that I mean that she can increase our stress response but it kind of makes us I mean when we have a coffee you can feel all wired for a little bit but that's not sustainable either I mean you've kind of crashed and you feel like you need another one so really it kind of has a bit of a upset effect if you feel like you really need a coffee the actually best thing to do is to not have a coffee I really recommend just lowering your stimulants and your caffeine intake if you can and then also unless you talk about alcohol I mean alcohol have a similar effect but also especially be mindful with alcohol which has a lot of sugar in it like for example if your so many drinks like a lot of spirits like maybe run for example that is filled with sugar like loads of cane sugar so yeah you want to be mindful as well about things like that because sometimes you just focus on the food you don't really think about like the liquids and the drinks because they're filled with things as well so if you feel like your diet could be better then that would be the first thing I would focus on is just getting your diet into a really really good place and then the other thing is obviously exercise like I said in the other video it's a little bit of background for appetitive one but exercise it's gonna really help out with your hormonal level the only thing I would say if you've got high testosterone is that I'd be mindful with how much weight lifting you are doing I would make sure that you do balance it out and don't only focus on ways because weights can really boost our testosterone actually I did a vlog like a while like not too long ago where basically I started doing a lot more weights and I started breaking out those I couldn't figure out and then I realized the link between weightlifting and testosterone and then let's just literally chugged so much spearmint tea and it sorted out for me and now I'm really mindful when I exercise to make sure that I still do my ways and I still do my weight training but I do also in corpora like a bit cardio in there and you know other types of exercise as well to cut and keep it balanced and also if you are someone who goes to the gym you find your breakout from like and they're doing weight I do recommend put some spearmint like participant mint tea bag inside your water and drink that as well I actually find it really really good and really helpful so yeah the things you want to change your diet you know that's an obvious one processed are sugar all that stuff but I've mentioned get that out make that switch second one try the Spearman honestly it is like game changer yourself with really high testosterone exercise stress levels get some good sleep and also reduce your caffeine stimulant and like alcohol consumption and that should really really play effect as well and also to be really honest with you if you make those kind of changes you should see a really positive impact on your body in general but they are my top tips if you're suffering with hyperandrogenism and they're the first things I just want you guys to focus on first and then you know maybe once we've done this pcs series I'll do a PCO series too and we'll go even beyond this light stage but this whole series is kind of give me the fundamentals and the key things to really look into and you switch up so anyway guys I hope this video was helpful tomorrow's video it's gonna be all about how to balance your hormones regulate your hormones regulate your cycle if you haven't had your period how to get your period back anything related to that that is what tomorrow's videos are going to be make sure you have subscribed to my channel and make sure over here 7:00 p.m. tomorrow to see my tips and tricks on how to balance your hormones and regulate your psyche or even just get your period back if that is something that you're suffering with so anyway I hope this video was helpful make sure give it a big thumbs up if you did because it helps me out so much and I'll see you guys on the next video bye [Music] [Music]	Low Medical Info

gonadotropin releasing hormone or gnrh is released from the hypothalamus in a normal pulsatile fashion and then travels in the blood to the cells of the anterior pituitary to cause release of luteinizing hormone or lh and follicle stimulating hormone or fsh lh and fsh then travel in the blood to the ovary to act on the thecal and granulosa cells of the follicle causing them to work together to produce mainly estrogen before ovulation during the follicular phase and mostly progesterone after ovulation during the luteal phase polycystic ovarian syndrome abbreviated pcos occurs when follicles do not ovulate remember that progesterone from the cells of the ovary has a negative feedback effect on gnrh to reduce it and keep its frequency in normal range which in turn keeps lh and fsh at the correct ratios pcos occurs due to an increase in the normal pulsatile gnrh release from the hypothalamus the increase in gnrh pulse frequency seen in pcos occurs due to the lack of high progesterone during a luteal phase if a follicle does not ovulate a corpus luteum is not created and without a corpus luteum there is no surge in progesterone progesterone is a powerful inhibitor of gnrh so lack of it leads to a higher pulse frequency seen in pcos this increased pulse frequency leads to an increase in the amount of lh over fsh since lh secreting cells are more responsive to a faster pulse frequency of gnrh release fsh is needed to help a follicle mature to the point that it can ovulate with pcos lh is relatively higher and fsh is relatively lower this lower fsh results in follicles not maturing enough to become a full functional graphene follicle that can ovulate the follicles that don't ovulate are the cysts that form on the ovary with picas multiple cysts on the ovary represent past failed follicular ovulation events and are characteristic of pcos also excessive lh levels stimulate the thecal cells to produce higher amounts of androgens which leads to other symptoms characteristic of pcos this hyperandrogenism causes hirsutism and acne there is also menstrual irregularity due to hormone imbalances infertility occurs because there is no ovulation insulin also plays an important role in pcos it is released from the pancreas and can stimulate steroidogenesis in the thecal cells of the ovary to increase androgen production insulin also increases steroidogenesis in the adrenal cortex to further increase androgens when insulin increases steroidogenesis in these cells the result is even more androgen release the androgens can have a negative feedback effect on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland making hormone imbalances even more complicated and ovulation even more difficult finally androgens cause decreased sensitivity to insulin which creates an environment where the body must secrete more insulin in order to compensate this situation is often called insulin resistance with insulin resistance more insulin is released from the pancreas this added insulin causes even more stimulation of fecal cells to produce even more androgens the whole process is one big vicious cycle to summarize gnrh of the hypothalamus is released in pulses and without a progesterone surge in the luteal phase gnrh pulse frequency increases lh secreting cells of the anterior pituitary are more sensitive to the higher gnrh pulse frequency which leads to higher relative levels of lh and lower fsh levels this increased lh stimulates the fecal cells of the ovary to make more androgens elevated androgens cause hirsutism acne and increased insulin resistance this increased insulin resistance causes insulin levels to rise further which in turn increases the production of androgens resulting in a positive feedback loop the lower fsh levels don't allow the follicle to develop into a mature graphene follicle that is capable of ovulating so a cysts form on the ovary without ovulation the corpus luteum doesn't form so there is no progesterone surge to suppress gnrh in the ludial phase this causes the higher gnrh pulse frequency and we are back to the beginning of the vicious cycle so you see there is a kind of chicken or the egg paradox what comes first insulin resistance triggering the whole thing or excessive androgen production it's not really known what the first trigger is it is known that increased androgens and insulin resistance are found together in women with pecos women with pcos are also an increased risk for developing endometrial cancer due to prolonged estrogen exposure without progesterone surge in the second half of the cycle this increased androgen can also lead to endometrial hyperplasia combined progesterone estrogen oral contraceptives are useful for pcos because progesterone inhibits the high pulse frequency of gnrh and estrogen helps with the acne and hirsutism other treatments include weight loss and the anti-diabetic drug metformin both of which bring down elevated insulin levels the potassium sparing drug spironolactone blocks androgen receptors limiting the action of the androgens to cause acne and hirsutism now for some questions please pause the video and think of your answers if you answered the following you are correct to be true would need to say that hirsutism is due to elevated androgens and those with pcos ovulate less not more the main hormone of the follicular phase is estrogen not progesterone spironolactone is the drug that blocks androgen receptors in the anti-diabetic drug metformin improves insulin resistance lh and fsh are released from the anterior pituitary not the hypothalamus and insulin will increase androgen production thanks for watching	Low Medical Info

Amylin also known as islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is a peptide hormone that is co-secreted  with insulin by the pancreatic beta cells. Amylin is found to have multiple physiologic effects and amylin receptors have been identified in a number of tissues. Amylin increases satiety and slows gastric emptying by binding to its receptors in the brain. In healthy individuals, amylin together with insulin suppresses the postprandial glucagon secretion.

8RN4bQBn1ls	UC3_WYu5dmqI6OdcIj8AVtng	1.0	Embryonic Development of the Islets of Langerhans	"The Islets of Langerhans are an important part of the human endocrine system, and understanding their formation is important for gaining insights into combating diseases such as diabetes.

These structures are formed from an initial cord, from which cells that express neurogenin-3 and emerge and form buds. The cells in these buds differentiate to form the mature islet, which then becomes vascularized, providing the blood with various hormones, including insulin.

Nadav Sharon of the Doug Melton group at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute approached us to visualize his research. In the process of creating the animation above, we developed a numerical model to emulate the behavior of the cells involved. The model to drive the animation proved very insightful and led to Sharon going back in the lab to validate our model. This in the end led to a contribution on our part to his publication in #Cell.

With Luke Whitehorn credited as co-author for the work he completed on this project. Typically, we are not part of the actual research but only help to communicate concepts and results. However, the project is a great example of how we develop tools and methods to visualize nature, as it has never been shown before, and we take great pride in this accolade.

They are comprised of beta cells that secrete insulin, alpha cells which secrete glucagon and several other and endocrine cell types. Type 1 diabetes is caused by the loss of the insulin secreting beta cells. Islet transplantation from cadaveric donors can cure the disease, but donor scarcity requires finding alternative sources. In vitro generation of islets from human embryonic stem cells could serve as an alternative. To enable their production, scientists at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute determined how islets form during embryonic development. In mice, islets start forming around the 13th day of pregnancy. At this time, the core of the developing pancreas is a network of epithelial tubes or ""cords"". The cord cells divide. Inhibition of Notch signaling induces some of the daughter cells to express Neurogenin3, and these cells start differentiating towards an endocrine fate. As the differentiating endocrine progenitors leave the epithelial cord, Neurogenin expression decreases and pan endocrine genes are activated such as Chromogranin_A are turned on. Cells leaving the cords maintain cell to cell contacts. As more cells leave the cord,  they push the earliest cells outward and form a ‚Äúpeninsula‚Äù, which will later on form the islet. The first cells to exit the cords turn on Glucagon and become alpha cells. Because they were the first cells to bud out, these alpha cells appear at the periphery. About a day later, insulin producing cells start to appear in increasing numbers. Because these beta cells originate from later progenitors, they are closer to the peninsular base. In the following days more cells leave the chords and join the peninsulas. Adjacent peninsulas may fuse and the peninsulas grow. As birth approaches, the production rate of new progenitors wanes. Peninsular growth is now driven by division of the differentiated hormonal cells. The initial architecture of the peninsula is maintained in the sphere, and so alpha cells appear as a mantle around a core of beta cells. Peninsulas appear along much of the cords and can be found as a continuous necklace that will later break into individual islets. During the entire process, the forming islets are vascularized. The islets are now ready to sense the amount of glucose in the blood and react by secreting Insulin and other hormones into the bloodstream.

Histology of Adipose Tissue: Shotgun Histology

White adipose tissue is composed of mature adipocytes, precursors (preadipocytes), endothelial cells, macrophages, and other immune cells. The phenotype, amount, and biology of each adipose tissue component are profoundly altered in human obesity. Low-grade inflammation both at the local and systemic levels characterizes obesity and appears to have a key role in mediating the consequence of increased adipose tissue mass on metabolic and vascular co-morbidities. Moreover, a new concept of accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components in adipose tissue has been recently proposed. Integrity of the ECM is essential for the proper development of AT in a physiological context. In pathologic conditions, more knowledge is nevertheless necessary to understand the contribution of ECM modifications and the consequence of fibrous depots. Observations in morbidly obese subjects suggest that the amount of fibrosis might hamper fat mass loss induced by surgery.

About this Series

Patients with diabetes have a 30% increased risk of developing depression after their diagnosis. Researchers have long attributed the association of these two conditions to shared risk factors, such as sedentary lifestyle and obesity. However, new research suggests that the link is bi-directional: A history of depression is associated with a 60% increased risk for incident type 2 diabetes. Though the cause is unknown, this interplay between diabetes and depression results in psychosocial barriers that can affect patient adherence to diabetic regimens intended to control glucose levels.

Leading translational diabetes researcher Dr Mary de Groot and her colleagues at the Indiana University School of Medicine are investigating the links between diabetes and depression in hopes of uncoupling these debilitating conditions. The team is developing approaches to diabetes management that incorporate mental health care, wellness, and counseling. Their goal is to initiate personalized care plans that meet individual patient needs and empower patients to take responsibility for the management of their disease."	193000.0	PT5M52S	2d	hd	False		0.0			2589.0	37.0	0.0	2.0	2006-04-07T20:39:51Z	Medscape	18350700.0	our clinical assumptions for many years have been that well diabetes is hard enough it requires multiple self-care behaviors it requires multiple medications it requires multiple doctors visits over the course of the year depression could be a natural consequence of managing a chronic illness and in fact we have literature that suggests that that's true what we've also learned though is that a lifetime history of major depression increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life [Music] you get a group of people who have depression a group of people who don't have depression the people with depression are more likely to get diabetes one of the the multi-million dollar questions in the area of diabetes and depression is the question of how do these two comorbidities go go together and the answer that we have right now is that we don't really truly know at this point it's important that we learn how these two disorders not only co-occur but then how they may synergistically exacerbate one another the hypotheses for linking depression to type 2 diabetes biologically are around chronic inflammation and chronic resetting of brain control of metabolism there are a number of theories that have been posited one of those theories um is the stress response so that involves the hypothalamic pituitary axis of the brain and that the stress response may upregulate serotonin production in the brain and that that may have effects then on both behavior and also biology in terms of blood glucose management another hypothesis is the inflammatory system we know that inflammation promotes diabetes and depression is associated with inflammation we have this sort of two-way step between depression and diabetes through an inflammation pathway the brain control systems are really very much a mystery still and we know that depression is biologically a disordered set of brain controls it there's no reason to think that just because it's affecting mood doesn't mean it doesn't spill over into control of metabolism and metabolism is strongly controlled centrally so there's a sort of broad hypothesis that disordered brain regulation is part of it but we don't have any of the steps that make those links but of course there's behavioral component of depression that can promote diabetes as well things like the sedentary behavior that comes with depression or the changes in dietary pattern that come with depression that are then promoting diabetes along the known pathways related to obesity for example that don't have any direct relationship to the biological phenomena but are still part of the connection between depression and diabetes so depression behaviors can promote diabetes independent of any biological phenomena depression lies along a continuum at one end would be what we now understand to be diabetes related distress so that is specific to the experience of managing and living with diabetes in the middle of the continuum is what we would consider to be depressive symptoms so those may be transient symptoms of feeling sad or blue or hopeless feeling a lack of interest in things we would otherwise enjoy changes in sleep changes in appetite changes in concentration perhaps transient thoughts of death and then at the far end of the continuum is what we would consider to be diagnosable clinical depression so and that has a hierarchy of diagnoses the top of the hierarchy representing the most severe form is major depressive disorder in which at least five of those symptoms are present and that those are present most of the day nearly every day for at least a two-week period and that that causes impairment diabetes is a chronic permanent condition there are specific instances where we can reverse it and someone can you know get cured of their diabetes but for the most part it's something that you then have from that point forward for the rest of your life for some people that's a relatively minor thing depending on how intensively therapy is needed but for a lot of people that's a big deal as they move forward through their life requiring lots of finger stick testing lots of insulin injections it can be it can be a real burden that's not just a cost burden but a personal burden as they move through their lives we find that one in four patients that's about 21 percent of patients with type 1 diabetes and about 27 of patients with type 2 diabetes will have elevated depressive symptoms at some point in their life when we look at diagnosable clinical depression we see that rates of depression are somewhere between 11 and 15 percent that's true for both type 1 diabetes and for type 2 diabetes it is in excess of what we see in the general population and so a cause for concern not only do we have a larger proportion of people experiencing depressive symptoms and a somewhat larger proportion experiencing clinical depression but once depression takes hold in people with diabetes we're finding that it it's lasting much longer people who have established diabetes who have depression that's one of the almost impossible barriers to overcome we observed that that depression was associated with greater severity of diabetes complications and that has implications for complications for quality of life and ultimately for functional disability and early mortality join us next time when experts discuss collaborative approaches to caring for the physical mental and emotional needs of patients with diabetes and depression	High Medical Info

insulin we would understand the physiological context and the molecular mechanism by which insulin secretion takes place so let's start here is our pancreas if you zoom in to our pancreas and try to take a cross-section the pancreas would somewhat look like this and if we look at these green cells which are the depiction of beta cells now these beta cells secrete influent there are other cell types also present in the pancreas which we are not focusing right now but let's just focus on the pancreatic beta cells and try to understand that how pancreatic beta cell secret ensuing note that pancreatic beta-cell are very few in number compared to the other cell types present here now the pancreatic beta cell has specific gene expression pattern it expresses the is one gene which is located at the chromosome 11 P 15.5 locus now this particular gene encodes for insulin insulin is a protein easiest hormone so insulin has to be or the precursor form of the insulin has to be encoded by the gene and it is I&S gene which encodes the insulin now let's look at this process in bit more details that how insulin synthesis or insulin biogenesis takes place so from the insulin gene look at in the eleventh chromosome the mRNA would be produced now this mRNA once transcribed from the insulin gene it would be moving out through the nuclear pore and on the top of the rough endoplasmic reticulum the ribosomes which is sitting there they would convert the mRNA I mean they would translate the mRNA into peptide now these peptides at the precursor from form of the insulin now these peptides are going to be packaged inside the endoplasmic then it would move to Golgi from there it would be mobilized as a secretory vesicle so first it is packaged in endoplasmic reticulum then further it would be it would be moved to the cells secretory pathway via the Golgi apparatus and it would be almost ready to secrete now inside the secretory vesicle there are specific enzymes such as hormone converters and carboxy peptidase which would cleave the sea peptide of the ensuing in this case the sea peptide is depicted as an orange bead of string now the insulin hormone would be now packaged inside these vesicles secretory vesicles and ready to be secreted now since this is gene is expressing most of the time insulin is always ready insulin is ready and it is Queen packaged inside the vesicle ready to be secreted but without a particular context insulin is not secreted by the pancreatic beta-cell so what is the context here so insulin would be only secreted when the glucose level is high and it would try to divert the glucose inside the cells such that the cells can utilize the glucose that's the function of the insulin now how does at the first place the pitcher cell knows that there is ample amount of glucose present in the bloodstream the answer is simple right insulin is packaged in the vesicle but waiting for a signal to be discharged and the signal is basically the blood glucose level so let's say you have it in a donor tasty doughnut and the doughnut will be broken down and it's monosaccharides lot of glucose would be actually absorbed in the intestine and from the intestine the glucose would be elevated in your bloodstream but still it doesn't answer that how pancreatic cell would understand that glucose elevation took place in the bloodstream so pancreatic beta-cells specific channels or transporters I would say these are called blue to glucose transporter 2 here depicted as this blue on channels this glute 2 would allow glucose to enter from the blood vessel now the pancreas has many blood vessels supplying blood flow in the pancreas so these glucose which is carried in the blood flow would also get inside the pancreatic beta-cell and thereby it would trigger the secretion of insulin which are already packaged and ready inside the vesicle but let's just delve into the details of the molecular mechanism so let's see the process again what happens when glucose is absent what happens when glucose is present when glucose is absent in absence of glucose the pancreatic beta-cell is in a hyper polarized state in that situation one particular potassium channel which is ATP dependent is 1 as a result potassium leaks out and the cell is hyperpolarized but when buca's comes in glucose gets converted to glucose 6-phosphate entered like all is his pathway and from glycolysis pathway we know there would be ATP production and it eventually the glucose would be also used to produce ATP but when there is glucose there would be ATP and this ATP would eventually inhibit this potassium channel or the leaky potassium channel so once potassium is not moving out the cells would be rather going to a depolarized state in this situation several calcium channel also open in the pancreatic beta-cell which allows calcium influx inside the cell now calcium helps in vesicle docking events these vesicles which are filled with insulin are ready they are packaged with insulin they are waiting for a trigger to be released and that trigger for release is the elevation of the camp calcium which is due to elevation of glucose level in the pancreatic beta-cell now the calcium would help to modulate the snare complexes and allow the fusion of this vesicle with the membrane which would allow the insulin to be secreted and once the insulin is secreted it is ready to perform its job but how does insulin perform its job do you want to know Indians inertia you know that you have to watch my second video about how in fluid is the mechanism of insulin action action so I hope this video was informative this video was helpful if you liked this video give it a quick thumbs up and don't forget to Like share and

Video Summary:
Insulin is released by Œ≤ cells of the pancreas. An increase in blood glucose leads to increased glucose entry in the cell. Its metabolism produces ATPs. Increased ATP level causes closure of ATP-sensitive K channel. This leads to depolarization and thereby opening of voltage-gated Ca channels. Ca influx through these channel increases intracellular Ca which in turn causes exocytosis of insulin vesicles.

We know that insulin is involved in control of blood glucose level. The higher the blood glucose, the more the insulin secretion. This insulin in turn, decreases blood glucose level. But how exactly does increased blood glucose increase insulin secretion? That is what we will see in this video. Let's get started. Insulin is secreted from Œ≤ cells of pancreas. Before we understand secretion, let's quickly see what's the situation in the cell under it's resting condition. These cells have glucose transporter 2. Transport of glucose by GLUT2 is independent of insulin. Rather, it depends on blood glucose level. The higher the blood glucose, the more glucose enters the cell. We also have mitochondria and other stuff involved in glucose metabolism. Next we have ATP sensitive K channels. Constitutively these channels are open. Now we know that for any cell, intracellular K concentration is higher than extracellular K concentration. Due to this concentration gradient, K continuously diffuses out through these channels. Loss of positively charged K makes the inside of the cell electronegative. This voltage in turn is important for voltage sensitive Ca channels. At negative potential, these channels are closed. They open only when the cell depolarizes. Finally, we have pre-formed insulin stored in secretory vesicles. So this was the resting condition. Time to wake up the cell for insulin secretion. Let's say a person has taken energy rich meal. This increases the glucose level in the blood. This glucose enters the Œ≤ cells through glucose transporter 2. Metabolism of glucose in the cell produces ATPs. Increased ATP level leads to closing of the ATP sensitive K channels. So K efflux decreases and it starts getting accumulated in the cell. As they are positively charged, the voltage approaches electro positivity. This depolarization causes opening of the voltage sensitive Ca channels. This allows Ca influx. Increased intracellular Ca finally triggers exocytosis of insulin containing vesicles. And this results in release of insulin into the blood. So this is how glucose causes insulin release. Now let's talk about the rate of insulin secretion. Release of insulin is not an all or none phenomenon. Rate of release in fact depends on blood glucose level. The more the blood glucose, the more intense the entire process and ultimately more insulin is released. On the other hand, if blood glucose is low, the less intense the process and less insulin is released. I hope you now understand the mechanism of insulin release. That's it for this video.

There are a lot of big terms out there aren‚Äôt there?  And you really need to know what some of those terms are and why they are important.

One such term  is postprandial blood glucose.

The term ‚Äúpostprandial glucose‚Äù might sound like jargon, but it literally means ‚Äúsugar after the meal.‚Äù  So what we are talking about here is the blood glucose reading at about 1- 2 hours after a large meal. That part is pretty simple to answer.  But why should you know what that number is?

Some of you with pre-diabetes are checking your blood sugar in the mornings, some might not be.  It really depends on your control and what your doctor thinks is best.
  
But if you‚Äôre only testing first thing in the morning, you might be missing the full picture.

In my research I came across an interesting article in Everyday Health.  Some of what I am going to say about PPG is from that article.

The first morning glucose level check is usually the lowest of the day, and checking only in the morning is akin to purposefully ‚Äòblindfolding‚Äô yourself to only see the best-case scenario. mIf you want to see a more complete picture, mix it up and check your glucose level at various times during the.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends checking blood sugar levels before eating (fasting blood sugar) and then again one to two hours after the beginning of a meal ‚Äî particularly if target A1C goals aren‚Äôt being met. The test after the meal is called the postprandial glucose (PPG) test. You might also need to test your blood sugar at other times during the day, or after certain activities, depending on the information you and your medical team are trying to gather.

The PPG numbers are affected by a number of variables, including what you eat, how active you are, your insulin sensitivity, and how quickly food moves through your stomach.

The PPG gives us information about how the body is able to manage the blood glucose after a meal.  It informs us if the blood glucose has returned to normal after the meal intake.‚Äù

When blood sugar spikes after meals, and stays high, that can make it difficult for you to achieve your A1C and other blood sugar control goals, according to guidelines published by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE). If your A1C continues to be higher than your target goal, your chance of developing complications increases. So, PPG can help troubleshoot.

By measuring PPG, you can determine whether dietary modifications or pre-meal bolus insulin is needed to reduce these spikes.  If achieve your pre-meal glucose targets but your A1C remains above target, PPG monitoring and therapy is recommended.

Learning how to count carbohydrates can help you achieve your PPG goals.

Carbohydrates contribute significantly more to PPG than fat and protein content of a meal. Checking PPG regularly can help you figure out the best balance of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins."	144000.0	PT5M29S	2d	hd	True		0.0			7903.0	39.0	0.0	1.0	2016-11-29T06:06:38Z	Beat Your Diabetes	12648832.0	There are  a  lot of big terms out there aren‚Äôt there?

Metabolic syndrome, also called syndrome X or insulin resistance syndrome, refers to a combination of metabolic risk factors that increase the chance of developing cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks or strokes; and type 2 diabetes. 
Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed when a patient has at least three of the following:
- A waistline of 40 inches or more for men, or 35 inches or more for women; 
- A systolic blood pressure above 130 and a diastolic blood pressure above 85 mmHg, or if the patient is taking blood pressure-lowering medications; 
- A fasting blood sugar level above 100 mg/dL, or if the patient is taking glucose-lowering medications; 
- A triglyceride level greater than 150 mg/dL; 
- An HDL level of less than 40 mg/dL for men, or 50 mg/dLfor women.
Metabolic syndrome, in turn, has its own set of underlying risk factors, of which insulin resistance is most important. Insulin resistance is when the body‚Äôs cells do not respond well to insulin and therefore cannot use glucose; glucose stays in the blood, causing high blood sugar levels while the cells are deprived of nutrition. Insulin resistance can be acquired, hereditary, or mixed. Other risk factors include abdominal obesity, physical inactivity, aging, hormonal imbalances, and use of certain medications. Women are more susceptible than men. Some racial and ethnic groups are at higher risk than others.
Metabolic syndrome is often associated with excessive blood clotting and chronic low-grade inflammation, as well as several other conditions, but the cause-effect relationship is not clear.
The goal of treating metabolic syndrome is to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Treatment aims to lower blood pressure and cholesterol; and to manage diabetes, or prevent it, if it hasn‚Äôt already developed.

Insulin resistance can be acquired,¬†¬† hereditary, or mixed. Other risk factors¬†include abdominal obesity, physical inactivity,¬†¬† aging, hormonal imbalances, and use of certain¬†medications. Women are more susceptible than men.¬†¬† Some racial and ethnic groups¬†are at higher risk than others.¬† Metabolic syndrome is often associated with¬†excessive blood clotting and chronic low-grade¬†¬† inflammation, as well as several other conditions,¬†but the cause-effect relationship is not clear.¬† The goal of treating metabolic syndrome is to¬†reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.¬†¬† Treatment aims to lower blood pressure¬†and cholesterol; and to manage diabetes,¬†¬† or prevent it, if it hasn‚Äôt already developed.Lifestyle changes include a heart-healthy diet,¬†¬† physical activity plan, weight management,¬†stress management, and quitting smoking.¬† If lifestyle changes aren‚Äôt enough, medications¬†may be prescribed to lower LDL cholesterol¬†¬† and triglycerides; to reduce blood pressure,¬†blood sugar level, or to prevent blood clots.

Although the term ‚Äúlipid‚Äù includes several types of molecules, lipid metabolism usually refers to the breakdown and synthesis of fats. Fats are triglycerides, they are esters of glycerol and three fatty acids. Fats can come from the diet, from stores in adipose tissue, or can be synthesized from excess dietary carbohydrates in the liver.
Dietary fats are digested mainly in the small intestine, by the action of bile salts and pancreatic lipase. Bile salts emulsify fats. They act as a detergent, breaking large globules of fat into smaller micelles, making them more accessible to lipase. Pancreatic lipase then converts triglycerides into monoglycerides, free fatty acids, and glycerol. These products move into the cells of intestinal epithelium - the enterocytes, inside which they re-combine again to form triglycerides. Triglycerides are packaged along with cholesterol into large lipoprotein particles called chylomicrons. Lipoproteins enable transport of water-insoluble fats within aqueous environments. Chylomicrons leave the enterocytes, enter lymphatic capillaries, and eventually pass into the bloodstream, delivering fats to tissues. The walls of blood capillaries have a surface enzyme called lipoprotein lipase. This enzyme hydrolyzes triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol, enabling them to pass through the capillary wall into tissues, where they are oxidized for energy, or re-esterized for storage. 
Fats that are synthesized endogenously in the liver are packed into another type of lipoprotein, the VLDL, to be transported to tissues, where triglycerides are extracted in the same way. 
When required, fat stores in adipose tissue are mobilized for energy production, by the action of hormone-sensitive lipase, which responds to hormones such as epinephrine.
Lipid metabolism pathways are closely connected to those of carbohydrate metabolism. Glycerol is converted to a glycolysis intermediate, while fatty acids undergo beta-oxidation to generate acetyl-CoA. Each round of beta-oxidation removes 2 carbons from the fatty acid chain, releasing one acetyl-CoA, which can then be oxidized in the citric acid cycle. Beta-oxidation also produces several high-energy molecules which are fed directly to the electron transport system. Fats yield more energy per unit mass than carbohydrates. 
When acetyl-CoA is produced in excess, it is diverted to create ketone bodies. During glucose starvation, ketone bodies are an important source of fuel, especially for the brain. However, ketone bodies are acidic, and when produced in excess, can overwhelm the buffering capacity of blood plasma, resulting in metabolic acidosis, which can lead to coma and death. Ketoacidosis is a serious complication of diabetes, in which cells must oxidize fats for fuel as they cannot utilize glucose. Extreme diets that are excessively low in carbohydrates and high in fat may also result in ketoacidosis.
On the other hand, diets that are high in carbohydrates generate excess acetyl-CoA that can be converted into fatty acids. Synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA is stimulated by citrate, a marker of energy abundance, and inhibited by excess of fatty acids. Fatty acids can be converted into triglycerides, for storage or synthesis of other lipids, by combining with glycerol derived from a glycolysis intermediate."	1070000.0	PT4M16S	2d	sd	True		0.0			529071.0	10101.0	0.0	116.0	2014-01-02T04:50:59Z	Alila Medical Media	142574106.0	Although the term ‚Äúlipid‚Äù includes severaltypes of molecules, lipid metabolism usually refers to the breakdown and synthesis of fats.

Fat is an important component of our diet. It is both protective and contributes to heart disease depending on the type of fat. Fat can be saturated on unsaturated foods which are more complicated in structure. In its complete form the fats are made up of triglycerides. Triglycerides are made up of three fatty acids joined to a glycerol backbone. We need to break down fat into its building blocks to be absorbed by our body.""

What iscellulitis? Cellulitis is a common bacterial skin infection that can spreadquickly and can be very serious. Cellulitis is caused by bacteria thatget into your skin. Bacteria are most likely to enter your skin where you havea cut, insect bite, scrape, burn, puncture wound, or patches of dry skin. Cellulitisis often caused by Staphylococcus bacteria. Symptoms of cellulitis include:skin redness, swelling, warmth, pain, and sometimes blisters with yellow fluid. Youcan also sometimes experience fever and swollen lymph nodes. The infection ismost common on the legs but can happen anywhere on the body. In a couple of daysit could spread from a spot the size of a quarter on your calf to cover yourentire lower leg. If the infection gets into the bloodstream you can have highfever, low blood pressure, and shutdown of some of your organs. Risk is higher forpeople who are overweight, have a weakened immune system, have other skindiseases like eczema or athlete's foot, already have a swollen arm or leg, use IVdrugs, or have had cellulitis before. Doctors diagnose cellulitis based on howyour skin looks. There are no tests to tell for sure. Cellulitis is typicallytreated with antibiotics taken by mouth but, sometimes when there is seriousinfection, by vein in the hospital. If you have cellulitis in your leg doctors willask you to elevate it. To prevent cellulitis keep skin woundsclean, cover them with a bandage, and apply an antibiotic cream for protection.You should also treat fungal infections such as athlete's foot and other skinconditions to help heal any breaks in the skin. If you have diabetes or poorcirculation examine your feet everyday, use a moisturizer, and avoid injury bywearing proper shoes.	Low Medical Info

Lantus¬Æ or Tresiba¬Æ? The referee has declared the winner, and thisfight wasn‚Äôt even close! First, some backstory to understand the importanceof this epic match. Lantus has been the champion of long-actinginsulin for over fifteen years. That‚Äôs right! Lantus was an amazing discovery for diabetesmanagement: the first long-acting basal insulin. Before the year 2000, doctors did not havemany types of insulin to choose from. Lantus is an analog of natural human insulin,meaning that the human insulin molecule was changed slightly in the lab, creating differencesin the way it is absorbed. In the case of U-100 glargine (the genericname of Lantus), there is an amino acid substitution and a slight lengthening of one of the twochains that make up the insulin molecule. When Lantus is injected, this alteration increasesthe time over which the insulin is absorbed, giving it a longer half-life than all theinsulins available previously. Fast-forward sixteen years, and Tresiba isnow punching its way to the top of the basal insulin market. Several changes were made to slow the absorptionof Tresiba, making its effect on lower blood sugar more predictable. As compared to regular insulin, Tresiba containsan amino acid deletion and a special bond to a fatty acid. These changes prolong the absorption of Tresiba,and allow it to reversibly bind to the main protein in the blood, called albumin. The result of these modifications is a newclass of insulin referred to as ‚Äòultra-long-acting basal insulin.‚Äô Some key differences between Lantus and Tresibaare: Tresiba‚Äôs half-life and duration of actionare approximately twice as long as Lantus. Tresiba has less variability in its abilityto lower blood sugar values, meaning it is more consistent. Tresiba causes up to 50 percent less hypoglycemiaas compared to Lantus. There is also some evidence that Tresiba canbe used at lower doses. If switching from Lantus to Tresiba, it isrecommended to start at 80 percent of the dose. The last major difference between Lantus andTresiba is that Tresiba Flextouch can do some damage to your pocketbook, as it weighs inat nearly twice the price of Lantus. But even at its higher cost, Tresiba‚Äôs prolongedabsorption and length of action, less hypoglycemic events as compared to Lantus, similar A1creductions, and the added benefit of using lower doses of insulin make Tresiba the clearwinner of this insulin pen throwdown.

Ryan life of T p.m. gia Greenbrier family medicine to talk more about intermittent fasting and for folks who may not have heard of this what is intermittent fasting well intermittent fasting in the study was defined as taking eating dinner one night and then waiting to the next night to eat dinner again but you could have clear fluids you could have some broth while you're waiting and then intermittent fast you just didn't want any calories during that time so does does this work better than reducing calories in terms of weight loss and disease management well when we look at weight loss they're both very similar they're basically calorie reduction so the biggest difference is if you're gonna a calorie count you got to do that every day you can't be good every day when you're looking at intermittent fasting you only have to be good for the one day the next day you can eat whatever you want the next day you got to be good again so it's whichever one you like better both of them shouldn't replace couldn't sound nutritional advice now we saw the study that CBS News talked about that some people use intermittent fasting they you know stretch for that long period of time and they were able to reverse their type 2 diabetes is this something that you see in the future as also a cure for diabetes I don't see it for as a cure now reversing diabetes is that diabetes a lot of times has a factor being obesity so it does help with weight loss so that's the biggest thing that we're doing it also helps with hypertension and high cholesterol as well so those are things we see that really respond when we lose weight so can I help yes and I've seen it in the office when somebody loses weight their diabetes goes away but if they ever gain that weight back it'll come right back that domino effect so we know that it can work but is this a safe thing is this something that should be recommended for weight loss it actually is safe so it does have good data that says it's safe for weight loss however if you have diabetes you want to talk with your doctor because a lot of the medications that we put you on for our diabetes can lower your blood sugar so can fasting so make sure you consult your doctor before you start on this and as we already know sound nutritional advice regular exercise is always the key to success - alright doctor like thank you for talking about this we've talked about this sometimes we intermittent fast accidentally accidentally when you hear that stomachs growling right about now yeah doctor bye thank you	Low Medical Info
VxBJ0n0PZRE	UCLXjINL1hfayHfX7oOy7--Q	27.0	Polydipsia -  Why Am I Always Thirsty? - Most common causes of Polydipsia	"Polydipsia is excessive thirst or excessive  fluid intaking.  Most commonly water. 
In patients who drink large amounts of water, the kidneys compensate by excreting water up to a maximum of 12 Liter  per day. 
That‚Äôs why polydipsia frequently is associated with polyuria, meaning frequent urination. 
Excessive water intake we can define as  drinking water more then  4 liters per day. 
Intaking excessive thirst can be caused by different diseases, that‚Äôs why we will discuss most common causes. 
When excessive water intake is combination with frequent urination,  excessive eating,  Unexplained weight loss and fatigue, it can be diabetes mellitus type 2.  Characterized high glucose level in the blood.  If left untreated it can have fatal complications.
Excessive water intake because of diabetes mellitus probably is the most common cause of polydipsia.
increased thirst  and large amounts of dilute urine can be caused by another form of diabetes, called diabetes insipidus.  At this case, urine produced can be nearly 20 liters per day.
The symptoms of diabetes insipidus can looks like diabetes mellitus, but with normal glucose level. 

Polydipsia in combination with: nervousness, irritability, increased perspiration, heart racing, hand tremors, anxiety, trouble sleeping, thinning of the skin, fine brittle hair, and muscular weakness, can be caused by hyperhidrosis. When thyroid gland is producing, excessive amount of thyroid hormons. 
If person is otherwise healthy,  polydipsia can be caused by today's context of a healthier lifestyle. And patients believe intaking water is good for his Health.
Intaking anti depressants and anti psychotic medication can also cause polydipsia.  due to anticholinergic effects. 
Low level potassium can also cause  polydipsia, but its rare. Because mild deficiency of potassium doesn‚Äôt. and severe deficiency can cause hearth rhythm problems, weakness, muscle cramps. 
It can be caused by vomiting, diarrhea, medications like furosemide and steroids, dialysis, diabetes insipidus, hyperaldosteronism, hypomagnesemia, and not enough intake in the diet.

IF excessive thirst and water intake caused in the absence of physiological stimuli to drink, it is called primary polydipsia.  Primary polydipsia one of symptoms of psychiatric disorders.
And seen in some patients with mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. 

Polydipsia can in rare cases can be life threating.
Polydipsia causes polyuria,  increased loss of  sodium level because urine is  diluted.  And finally leads  to an  seizures and cardiac arrest can occur.

dietitian at Joslin Diabetes Center today we're going to talk about carbohydrate counting carbohydrate counting is a method to use to help manage blood sugar levels with type 1 diabetes you must match carbohydrate intake in mealtime insulin dose basically doing what the pancreas would do if you did not have diabetes remember that bolus insulin helps control high blood sugars caused by a meal or snack you will need to know the amount of carbohydrate in food this will determine how much insulin you take food contains carbohydrate protein and fat these provide calories for energy and nutrients to keep your body healthy carbohydrate breaks down to glucose which is another word for sugar it has the largest impact on blood sugar level protein and fat have little effect on blood sugar carbohydrates are starches or sugars carbohydrates will raise your blood sugar and require mealtime insulin for blood sugar control examples of carbohydrates are starches such as bread crackers pasta grains rice potatoes cereals pretzels popcorn and pizza and they require bolus insulin starchy vegetables are also carbohydrates such as corn kidney beans lentils black beans garbanzo beans baked beans potatoes and peas non starchy vegetables are lower in carbohydrates example of Lumbees include celery carrots tomato spinach cucumbers peppers cabbage cauliflower broccoli green beans lettuce and onions they may require a bolus dose depending on the amount consumed foods containing natural sugars such as fruit milk and plain yogurt are sources of carbohydrate even though these foods contain natural sugars and are healthy foods they will still raise your blood sugar added sugars contain carbohydrate these include syrups jellies desserts ice cream candy cakes cookies honey maple syrup agave and sugar protein foods have little effect on blood sugar they do not require bolus insulin examples of these are cottage cheese eggs string cheese meats such as beef and chicken and seafood such as salmon and tuna fish breading added to meats such as fried chicken or meatloaf may add carbohydrate and raise the blood sugar other examples of protein foods are pork ham fish shellfish including shrimp and scallops cheese turkey nuts hot dogs Bologna bacon sausage pepperoni and salami note that some protein foods are high in fat and sodium and are recommended to be eaten less often for a healthy diet fats also have little effect on blood sugar and do not require bolus insulin examples of fats are oils butter cream salad dressing cream cheese sour cream and mayonnaise it is important for everyone to eat a balanced diet of mostly healthy carbohydrates such as fruits vegetables whole grains and low-fat milk along with lean proteins and healthy fats occasional treats are acceptable carbohydrates are measured in units called grams the average number of grams of a carbohydrate can range between 30 to 100 grams per meal the amount of carbohydrate that is right for you will depend on your weight physical activity and stage of growth it is important to measure food to know how much carbohydrate is in the food you are eating use measuring cups measuring spoons scoops and scales to determine portion sizes for accurate carbohydrate counting accuracy with carb counting can help with blood sugar control food labels are the first place you look to find out the amount of carbohydrate in a food look at the total carbohydrate and serving size this food has 40 grams of carbohydrate per 3/4 cup if you have one and a half cups that would be two servings and equal 80 grams of carbohydrate if an item does not have a food label you can use resources such as calorie king book calorie King website or phone app or my fitness fat pal phone app these will tell you the amount of carbohydrates per serving size select the Upstate Jocelin food choice list is another resource and list serving sizes containing 15 grams of carbohydrate let's practice carb counting if you were to have Cheerios milk and a banana for breakfast you would add them up individually first look at the Cheerios food label one cup is 22 grams and since you are having two cups you would double that to equal 44 grams of carbohydrates from Cheerios for the milk look at the food label and you see that one cup has 12 grams of carbohydrate since the banana does not have a food label you could use the calorie king app or website and search for a medium sized banana and find it has 27 grams of carbohydrate add them together to get 83 grams of carbohydrate for this meal to figure the amount of carbohydrate in a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with milk you would look up each item individually a slice of bread is 15 grams of carb 2 slices would equal 30 grams of carb 2 tablespoons of peanut butter is 6 grams of carbohydrate so if you are only having one tablespoon you would have you would take half of that which is 3 grams a tablespoon of jelly is 13 grams of carbohydrate a cup of milk is 12 grams of carbohydrate adding them all together you have 58 grams of total carbohydrate in this meal to figure out the amount of carbohydrate in this meal search for chicken on calorie King app or website and choose 4 ounce portion and you can see that it has no carbohydrate then look at the Upstate Joslin through choice list and you can see that 1/3 cup of cooked rice has 15 grams of carbohydrate and since you are having 1 cup that would equal 45 grams of carbs next search on calorie King app or website for broccoli and a 1 cup serving is 11 grams of carbohydrate the total for this meal will be 56 grams of carbohydrate in order to have energy throughout the day it is best to have three meals they should be approximately 4 to 5 hours apart with low or no carb snacks in between if desired snacks are allowed your provider will determine the number of grams of carb you can have it a snack some snacks are no carb and are allowed anytime some snacks are low carb and must be counted so don't go higher than your snack carb goal higher carb snacks may be allowed as directed by your provider these may or may not require a bolus dose of insulin the snack away handout gives you ideas for low carb no carb and 15 gram carb snacks your insulin to carb ratio will tell you how much mealtime insulin to take for food for example a ratio of 1 to 15 means you will take one unit bolus insulin for every 15 grams of carb if you eat 60 grams of carb you would take four units of bolus insulin for food and if you eat 100 grams of carb you would take six and a half units for food the insulin to carb ratio just covers food so if your blood sugar is high you will need to add more insulin pre or correction factor to lower blood glucose checking your blood loop blood sugar is the best way to know if your insulin or food intake needs to be adjusted	Low Medical Info

THE NUTRITION FACTS CANBE FOUND ON THE SIDE OR THE BACK OF THEFOOD PACKAGE. FIRST, YOU NEED TOLOOK AT THE SERVING SIZE, WHICH IS LISTED AT THETOP OF THE FOOD LABEL. THE SERVING SIZE LISTED ONTHIS LABEL IS 1 OUNCE. YOU MAY BE ASKING YOURSELF,""WHAT DOES 1 OUNCE LOOK LIKE?"" YOU CAN NEXT, LOOK AT THISAND FIND THAT THE WEIGHT OF 1 OUNCE OR 28 GRAMSIS ABOUT 11 CRISPS. WE ALL KNOW THAT THESECRISPS CAN BE BROKEN IN THE BAG AND IT MAY BE DIFFICULTTO COUNT OUT 11 CRISPS. SO WE RECOMMEND FORYOU TO USE A FOOD SCALE FOR ACCURATE CARBOHYDRATE. IF YOU WEIGHT THE CRISPSON A FOOD SCALE, YOU CAN WEIGH IT EITHERIN OUNCES OR IN GRAMS. REMEMBER THE WEIGHT INGRAMS IS NOT THE GRAMS OF CARBOHYDRATE. ONCE YOU HAVE WEIGHEDONE OUNCE OF CRISPS, YOU CAN LOOK FURTHER DOWNON THE FOOD LABEL TO FIND THE TOTAL GRAMSOF CARBOHYDRATE. THE GRAMS COUNTED HERE,1 OUNCE OF CRISPS EQUALS 23 GRAMS OF CARBOHYDRATE. THIS BAG OF CRISPSCONTAINS 10 SERVINGS. SO IF YOU EAT MORETHAN ONE SERVING, YOU ARE EATING MORE THAN23 GRAMS OF CARBOHYDRATE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOUEAT 2 OUNCES, YOU ARE EATING 46 GRAMSOF CARBOHYDRATE. IF YOU DOUBLETHE PORTION SIZE, YOU NEED TO DOUBLE THETOTAL CARBOHYDRATE GRAMS."	Low Medical Info
