Summary of Assignment
This Assignment has 3 questions to be solved using python program.

1. a) Input the string "Python" as a list of characters from console, delete at least 2 characters, reverse the resultant string and print it.
   Input string is accepted from console.Replace string function is used to delete characters and slicing to reverese the string. Program will raise exception if input string is empty or if at least 2 characters are not deleted.

2. Write a program that accepts a sentence and replace each occurrence of 'python' with 'pythons'.
   Input is entered from console.Replace string function is used to replace all occurrence of 'python' with 'pythons'. Program will raise exception if input string is empty.

3. Use the if statement conditions to write a program to print the letter grade based on an input class score. Use the grading scheme we are using in this class.
   if ,elif and else blocks are used to grade the class score using below grading scale for total score of 500.Exception is thrown if input is not a number.
