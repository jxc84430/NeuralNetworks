Summary of ICP_3:

This Assignment has 2 questions to be solved using python classes and Numpy.

1. Create a class Employee and then do the following
 
    • Create a data member to count the number of Employees
    
    • Create a constructor to initialize name, family, salary, department
    
    • Create a function to average salary
    
    • Create a Fulltime Employee class and it should inherit the properties of Employee class
    
    • Create the instances of Fulltime Employee class and Employee class and call their member functions.

2. Numpy

    Using NumPy create random vector of size 20 having only float in the range 1-20. 
    
    Then reshape the array to 4 by 5
    
    Then replace the max in each row by 0 (axis=1)
