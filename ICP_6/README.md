Summary of ICP_6:

This Assignment has 2 questions to be solved using keras.

1.Predicting the diabetes disease by Adding more Dense layers to the existing code and check how the accuracy changes.

    Accuracy has improved from 65% to 70%.
  
2. Change the data source to Breast Cancer dataset * available in the source code folder and make required changes. Report accuracy of the model.

    Without normalization accuracy is around 65%

3. Normalize the data before feeding the data to the model and check how the normalization change your accuracy (code given below).
   
   With normalization accuracy is around 97%


Use Image Classification on the hand written digits data set (mnist)
1. Plot the loss and accuracy for both training data and validation data using the history object in the source code.
   
    Plotted the graph using matplotlib
   
2. Plot one of the images in the test data, and then do inferencing to check what is the prediction of the model on that single image.
    
    Model has predicted correctly
    
3. We had used 2 hidden layers and Relu activation. Try to change the number of hidden layer and the activation to tanh or sigmoid and see what happens.
    
    After adding two more layers and using diffrent activation function. No much change is seen.
    
4. Run the same code without scaling the images and check the performance?

    without scaling accuracy is changed to 96% from 98%
