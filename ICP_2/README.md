Summary of ICP_2:

This Assignment has 3 questions to be solved using python program.

1a).  Write a program that takes two strings from the user: first_name, last_name. Pass these variables to fullname function that should return the (full name).
      
      Function : full_name(first_name,last_name)
      String join method is used to concatenate first and last name.
     
1b).  Write function named “string_alternative” that returns every other char in the full_name string.
      
      Function : string_alternative(fullname)
      List slicing is used to return alternate character.
     
2). Write a python program to find the wordcount in a file (input.txt) for each line and then print the output.
    
    Function : wordcount()
    Data is read from input file input.txt and split function is used to convert sentences into words.Dictionary is used to count words and output is written output.txt file.
    
3). Write a program, which reads heights (inches.) customers into a list and convert these heights to centimeters in a separate list using: 1) Nested Interactive loop.2) List comprehensions.

    Function : inch_to_cm_converter()
    Heights in inches are entered untill 0 or a negative number is entered.These values are stored in a list and new list is created by converting inches to centimeters.Finally output is displayed using for loop and list comprehension.
   
    
 All the above functions are called from main() function.
